  <h3>Event horizon</h3>


  <p>
  In general relativity, an event horizon is a boundary in spacetime
  beyond which events cannot affect an outside observer. In layman's
  terms, it is defined as "the point of no return", i.e., the point at
  which the gravitational pull becomes so great as to make escape
  impossible. An event horizon is most commonly associated with black
  holes. Light emitted from beyond the event horizon can never reach
  the outside observer. Likewise, any object approaching the horizon
  from the observer's side appears to slow down and never quite pass
  through the horizon, with its image becoming more and more
  redshifted as time elapses. The traveling object, however,
  experiences no strange effects and does, in fact, pass through the
  horizon in a finite amount of proper time.
  </p>

  <p>
  More specific types of horizon include the related but distinct
  absolute and apparent horizons found around a black hole. Still
  other distinct notions include the Cauchy and Killing horizon; the
  photon spheres and ergospheres of the Kerr solution; particle and
  cosmological horizons relevant to cosmology; and isolated and
  dynamical horizons important in current black hole research.
  </p>


  <h4>Event horizon of a black hole</h4>

  <p>
  One of the best-known examples of an event horizon derives from
  general relativity's description of a black hole, a celestial object
  so massive that no nearby matter or radiation can escape its
  gravitational field. Often, this is described as the boundary within
  which the black hole's escape velocity is greater than the speed of
  light. However, a more accurate description is that within this
  horizon, all lightlike paths (paths that light could take) and hence
  all paths in the forward light cones of particles within the
  horizon, are warped so as to fall farther into the hole. Once a
  particle is inside the horizon, moving into the hole is as
  inevitable as moving forward in time, and can actually be thought of
  as equivalent to doing so, depending on the spacetime coordinate
  system used.
  </p>


  <p>
  The surface at the Schwarzschild radius acts as an event horizon in
  a non-rotating body that fits inside this radius (although a
  rotating black hole operates slightly differently). The
  Schwarzschild radius of an object is proportional to its
  mass. Theoretically, any amount of matter will become a black hole
  if compressed into a space that fits within its corresponding
  Schwarzschild radius. For the mass of the Sun this radius is
  approximately 3 kilometers and for the Earth it is about 9
  millimeters. In practice, however, neither the Earth nor the Sun has
  the necessary mass and therefore the necessary gravitational force,
  to overcome electron and neutron degeneracy pressure. The minimal
  mass required for a star to be able to collapse beyond these
  pressures is the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit, which is
  approximately three solar masses.
  </p>


  <p>
  Black hole event horizons are widely misunderstood. Common, although
  erroneous, is the notion that black holes “vacuum up” material in
  their neighborhood, where in fact they are no more capable of
  “seeking out” material to consume than any other gravitational
  attractor. As with any mass in the universe, matter must come within
  its gravitational scope for the possibility to exist of capture or
  consolidation with any other mass. Equally common is the idea that
  matter can be observed “falling into” a black hole. This is not
  possible. Astronomers can only detect accretion disks around black
  holes, where material moves with such speed that friction creates
  high-energy radiation which can be detected. (Similarly, some matter
  from these accretion disks is forced out along the axes of spin of
  the black hole, creating visible jets when these streams interact
  with matter such as interstellar gas or when they happen to be aimed
  directly at earth.) Further, relativity dictates that anything
  approaching an event horizon will, from the point of view of an
  observer, never actually cross the horizon, but will approach ever
  more slowly, gaining mass as it does so and, correspondingly, any
  light it emits will be further and further redshifted.
  </p>

  <h4>Cosmic event horizon</h4>


  <p>
  In cosmology, the event horizon of the observable universe is the
  largest comoving distance from which light emitted now can ever
  reach the observer in the future. This differs from the concept of
  particle horizon, which represents the largest comoving distance
  from which light emitted in the past could have reached the observer
  at a given time. For events beyond that distance, light has not had
  time to reach our location, even if it were emitted at the time the
  universe began. How the particle horizon changes with time depends
  on the nature of the expansion of the universe. If the expansion has
  certain characteristics, there are parts of the universe that will
  never be observable, no matter how long the observer waits for light
  from those regions to arrive. The boundary past which events cannot
  ever be observed is an event horizon, and it represents the maximum
  extent of the particle horizon.
  </p>


  <p>
  Examples of cosmological models without an event horizon are
  universes dominated by matter or by radiation. An example of a
  cosmological model with an event horizon is a universe dominated by
  the cosmological constant (a de Sitter universe).
  </p>


  <p>
  A calculation of the speeds of the cosmological event and particle
  horizons was given in a paper on the FLRW cosmological model,
  approximating the universe as composed of non-interacting
  constituents, each one being a perfect fluid.
  </p>


  <h4>Apparent horizon of an accelerated particle</h4>

  <p>
  If a particle is moving at a constant velocity in a non-expanding
  universe free of gravitational fields, any event that occurs in that
  universe will eventually be observable by the particle, because the
  forward light cones from these events intersect the particle's world
  line. On the other hand, if the particle is accelerating, in some
  situations light cones from some events never intersect the
  particle's world line. Under these conditions, an apparent horizon
  is present in the particle's (accelerating) reference frame,
  representing a boundary beyond which events are unobservable.
  </p>

  <p>
  For example, this occurs with a uniformly accelerated particle. A
  space-time diagram of this situation is shown in the figure to the
  right. As the particle accelerates, it approaches, but never
  reaches, the speed of light with respect to its original reference
  frame. On the space-time diagram, its path is a hyperbola, which
  asymptotically approaches a 45 degree line (the path of a light
  ray). An event whose light cone's edge is this asymptote or is
  farther away than this asymptote can never be observed by the
  accelerating particle. In the particle's reference frame, there
  appears to be a boundary behind it from which no signals can escape
  (an apparent horizon).
  </p>


  <p>
  While approximations of this type of situation can occur in the real
  world (in particle accelerators, for example), a true event horizon
  is never present, as the particle must be accelerated indefinitely
  (requiring arbitrarily large amounts of energy and an arbitrarily
  large apparatus).
  </p>


  <h4>Interacting with an event horizon</h4>


  <p>
  A misconception concerning event horizons, especially black hole
  event horizons, is that they represent an immutable surface that
  destroys objects that approach them. In practice, all event horizons
  appear to be some distance away from any observer, and objects sent
  towards an event horizon never appear to cross it from the sending
  observer's point of view (as the horizon-crossing event's light cone
  never intersects the observer's world line). Attempting to make an
  object near the horizon remain stationary with respect to an
  observer requires applying a force whose magnitude increases
  unbounded (becoming infinite) the closer it gets.
  </p>


  <p>
  For the case of a horizon perceived by a uniformly accelerating
  observer in empty space, the horizon seems to remain a fixed
  distance from the observer no matter how its surroundings
  move. Varying the observer's acceleration may cause the horizon to
  appear to move over time, or may prevent an event horizon from
  existing, depending on the acceleration function chosen. The
  observer never touches the horizon and never passes a location where
  it appeared to be.
  </p>

  <p>
  For the case of a horizon perceived by an occupant of a de Sitter
  Universe, the horizon always appears to be a fixed distance away for
  a non-accelerating observer. It is never contacted, even by an
  accelerating observer.
  </p>


  <p>
  For the case of the horizon around a black hole, observers
  stationary with respect to a distant object will all agree on where
  the horizon is. While this seems to allow an observer lowered
  towards the hole on a rope (or rod) to contact the horizon, in
  practice this cannot be done. The proper distance to the horizon is
  finite, so the length of rope needed would be finite as well, but if
  the rope were lowered slowly (so that each point on the rope was
  approximately at rest in Schwarzschild coordinates), the proper
  acceleration (G-force) experienced by points on the rope closer and
  closer to the horizon would approach infinity, so the rope would be
  torn apart. If the rope is lowered quickly (perhaps even in
  freefall), then indeed the observer at the bottom of the rope can
  touch and even cross the event horizon. But once this happens it is
  impossible to pull the bottom of rope back out of the event horizon,
  since if the rope is pulled taut, the forces along the rope increase
  without bound as they approach the event horizon and at some point
  the rope must break. Furthermore, the break must occur not at the
  event horizon, but at a point where the second observer can observe
  it.
  </p>


  <p>
  Observers crossing a black hole event horizon can calculate the
  moment they have crossed it, but will not actually see or feel
  anything special happen at that moment. In terms of visual
  appearance, observers who fall into the hole perceive the black
  region constituting the horizon as lying at some apparent distance
  below them, and never experience crossing this visual horizon. Other
  objects that had entered the horizon along the same radial path but
  at an earlier time would appear below the observer but still above
  the visual position of the horizon, and if they had fallen in
  recently enough the observer could exchange messages with them
  before either one was destroyed by the gravitational
  singularity. Increasing tidal forces (and eventual impact with the
  hole's singularity) are the only locally noticeable effects.
  </p>


  <h4>Beyond general relativity</h4>

  <p>
  The description of event horizons given by general relativity is
  thought to be incomplete. When the conditions under which event
  horizons occur are modeled using a more comprehensive picture of the
  way the universe works, that includes both relativity and quantum
  mechanics, event horizons are expected to have properties that are
  different from those predicted using general relativity alone.
  </p>


  <p>
  At present, it is expected that the primary impact of quantum
  effects is for event horizons to possess a temperature and so emit
  radiation. For black holes, this manifests as Hawking radiation, and
  the larger question of how the black hole possesses a temperature is
  part of the topic of black hole thermodynamics. For accelerating
  particles, this manifests as the Unruh effect, which causes space
  around the particle to appear to be filled with matter and
  radiation.
  </p>


  <p>
  A complete description of event horizons is expected to, at minimum,
  require a theory of quantum gravity. One such candidate theory is
  M-theory. Another such candidate theory is loop quantum gravity.
  </p>

  <h4>Loop quantum gravity</h4>

  <p>
  Loop quantum gravity is a theory that attempts to describe the
  quantum properties of the universe and gravity. It is also a theory
  of quantum space and quantum time because, according to general
  relativity, the geometry of spacetime is a manifestation of
  gravity. LQG is an attempt to merge and adapt standard quantum
  mechanics and standard general relativity. The main output of the
  theory is a physical picture of space where space is granular. The
  granularity is a direct consequence of the quantization. It has the
  same nature as the granularity of the photons in the quantum theory
  of electromagnetism or the discrete levels of the energy of the
  atoms. Here, it is space itself that is discrete. In other words,
  there is a minimum distance possible to travel through it.
  </p>

  <p>
  More precisely, space can be viewed as an extremely fine fabric or
  network "woven" of finite loops. These networks of loops are called
  spin networks. The evolution of a spin network over time is called a
  spin foam. The predicted size of this structure is the Planck
  length, which is approximately 10<sup>−35</sup> meters. According to
  the theory, there is no meaning to distance at scales smaller than
  the Planck scale. Therefore, LQG predicts that not just matter, but
  also space itself has an atomic structure.
  </p>

  <p>
  Today LQG is a vast area of research, developing in several
  directions, which involves about 30 research groups worldwide.  They
  all share the basic physical assumptions and the mathematical
  description of quantum space. The full development of the theory is
  being pursued in two directions: the more traditional canonical loop
  quantum gravity, and the newer covariant loop quantum gravity, more
  commonly called spin foam theory.
  </p>

  <p>
  Research into the physical consequences of the theory is proceeding
  in several directions. Among these, the most well-developed is the
  application of LQG to cosmology, called loop quantum cosmology
  (LQC). LQC applies LQG ideas to the study of the early universe and
  the physics of the Big Bang. Its most spectacular consequence is
  that the evolution of the universe can be continued beyond the Big
  Bang. The Big Bang appears thus to be replaced by a sort of cosmic
  Big Bounce.
  </p>

  <p>
  In 1986, Abhay Ashtekar reformulated Einstein's general relativity
  in a language closer to that of the rest of fundamental
  physics. Shortly after, Ted Jacobson and Lee Smolin realized that
  the formal equation of quantum gravity, called the Wheeler–DeWitt
  equation, admitted solutions labelled by loops, when rewritten in
  the new Ashtekar variables, and Carlo Rovelli and Lee Smolin defined
  a nonperturbative and background-independent quantum theory of
  gravity in terms of these loop solutions. Jorge Pullin and Jerzy
  Lewandowski understood that the intersections of the loops are
  essential for the consistency of the theory, and the theory should
  be formulated in terms of intersecting loops, or graphs.
  </p>

  <p>
  In 1994, Rovelli and Smolin showed that the quantum operators of the
  theory associated to area and volume have a discrete spectrum. That
  is, geometry is quantized. This result defines an explicit basis of
  states of quantum geometry, which turned out to be labelled by Roger
  Penrose's spin networks, which are graphs labelled by spins.
  </p>

  <p>
  The canonical version of the dynamics was put on firm ground by
  Thomas Thiemann, who defined an anomaly-free Hamiltonian operator,
  showing the existence of a mathematically consistent
  background-independent theory. The covariant or spinfoam version of
  the dynamics developed during several decades, and crystallized in
  2008, from the joint work of research groups in France, Canada, UK,
  Poland, and Germany, lead to the definition of a family of
  transition amplitudes, which in the classical limit can be shown to
  be related to a family of truncations of general relativity. The
  finiteness of these amplitudes was proven in 2011. It requires
  the existence of a positive cosmological constant, and this is
  consistent with observed acceleration in the expansion of the
  Universe.

            <div class=env>Augsburg. Ein Garten.</div>

            <div class=env>Zwei Nürnberger Kaufleute.</div>

            <div class=speech><div class=name>Erster Kaufmann</div> Hier wollen wir stehn, denn da muß der Kaiser vorbei. Er kommt eben den langen Gang herauf.</div>

            <div class=speech><div class=name>Zweiter Kaufmann</div> Wer ist bei ihm?</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Erster Kaufmann</div> Adelbert von Weislingen!</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Zweiter Kaufmann</div> Bambergs Freund! Das ist gut.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Erster Kaufmann</div> Wir wollen einen Fußfall thun, und ich will reden.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Zweiter Kaufmann</div> Wohl, da kommen sie.</div>

            <div class=env>Kaiser. Weislingen.</div>

            <div class=speech><div class=name>Erster Kaufmann</div> Er sieht verdrießlich aus.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Kaiser</div> Ich bin unmuthig, Weislingen, und wenn ich auf mein vergangenes Leben zurück sehe, möcht’ ich verzagt werden; so viel halbe, so viel verunglückte Unternehmungen! und das alles, weil kein Fürst im Reich so klein ist, dem nicht mehr an seinen Grillen gelegen wäre als an meinen Gedanken.</div>

            <div class=env>Die Kaufleute werfen sich ihm zu Füßen.</div>

            <div class=speech><div class=name>Kaufmann</div> Allerdurchlauchtigster! Großmächtigster!</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Kaiser</div> Wer seid ihr? Was gibt’s?</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Kaufmann</div> Arme Kaufleute von Nürnberg, Eurer Majestät Knechte, und flehen um Hülfe. Götz von Berlichingen und Hanns von Selbitz haben unser dreißig, die von der Frankfurter Messe kamen, im Bambergischen Geleite niedergeworfen und beraubt; wir bitten Eure Kaiserliche Majestät um Hülfe, um Beistand, sonst sind wir alle verdorbene Leute, genöthigt unser Brot zu betteln.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Kaiser</div> Heiliger Gott! Heiliger Gott! Was ist das? Der eine hat nur Eine Hand, der andere nur Ein Bein; wenn sie denn erst zwei Hände hätten, und zwei Beine, was wolltet ihr dann thun?</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Kaufmann</div> Wir bitten Eure Majestät unterthänigst, auf unsere bedrängten Umstände ein mitleidiges Auge zu werfen.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Kaiser</div> Wie geht’s zu! Wenn ein Kaufmann einen Pfeffersack verliert, soll man das ganze Reich aufmahnen; und wenn Händel vorhanden sind, daran Kaiserlicher Majestät und dem Reich viel gelegen ist, daß es Königreich, Fürstenthum, Herzogthum und anders betrifft, so kann euch kein Mensch zusammen bringen.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Weislingen</div> Ihr kommt zur ungelegnen Zeit. Geht und verweilt einige Tage hier.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Kaufleute</div> Wir empfehlen uns zu Gnaden. (Ab.)</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Kaiser</div> Wieder neue Händel. Sie wachsen nach wie die Köpfe der Hydra.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Weislingen</div> Und sind nicht auszurotten als mit Feuer und Schwert, und einer muthigen Unternehmung.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Kaiser</div> Glaubt ihr?</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Weislingen</div> Ich halte nichts für thunlicher, wenn Eure Majestät und die Fürsten sich über andern unbedeutenden Zwist vereinigen könnten. Es ist mit nichten ganz Deutschland, das über Beunruhigung klagt. Franken und Schwaben allein glimmt noch von den Resten des innerlichen verderblichen Bürgerkriegs. Und auch da sind viele der Edeln und Freien, die sich nach Ruhe sehnen. Hätten wir einmal diesen Sickingen, Selbitz – Berlichingen auf die Seite geschafft, das Übrige würde bald von sich selbst zerfallen. Denn sie sind’s, deren Geist die aufrührische Menge belebt.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Kaiser</div> Ich möchte die Leute gerne schonen, sie sind tapfer und edel. Wenn ich Krieg führte, müßten sie mit mir zu Felde.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Weislingen</div> Es wäre zu wünschen, daß sie von jeher gelernt hätten ihrer Pflicht zu gehorchen. Und dann wär’ es höchst gefährlich ihre aufrührischen Unternehmungen durch Ehrenstellen zu belohnen. Denn eben diese Kaiserliche Mild’ und Gnade ist’s, die sie bisher so ungeheuer mißbrauchten, und ihr Anhang, der sein Vertrauen und Hoffnung darauf setzt, wird nicht ehe zu bändigen sein, bis wir sie ganz vor den Augen der Welt zu nichte gemacht, und ihnen alle Hoffnung jemals wieder empor zu kommen völlig abgeschnitten haben.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Kaiser</div> Ihr rathet also zur Strenge?</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Weislingen</div> Ich sehe kein ander Mittel, den Schwindelgeist, der ganze Landschaften ergreift, zu bannen. Hören wir nicht schon hier und da die bittersten Klagen der Edeln, daß ihre Unterthanen, ihre Leibeignen sich gegen sie auflehnen und mit ihnen rechten, ihnen die hergebrachte Oberherrschaft zu schmälern drohen, so daß die gefährlichsten Folgen zu fürchten sind?</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Kaiser</div> Jetzt wär’ eine schöne Gelegenheit wider den Berlichingen und Selbitz; nur wollt’ ich nicht daß ihnen was zu Leid’ geschehe. Gefangen möcht’ ich sie haben, und dann müßten sie Urfehde schwören, auf ihren Schlössern ruhig zu bleiben, und nicht aus ihrem Bann zu gehen. Bei der nächsten Session will ich’s vortragen.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Weislingen</div> Ein freudiger beistimmender Zuruf wird Eurer Majestät das Ende der Rede ersparen. (Ab.)</div>

            <div class=speech><div class=name>Sickingen</div> Ja, ich komme eure edle Schwester um ihr Herz und ihre Hand zu bitten.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> So wollt’ ich ihr wärt eher kommen. Ich muß euch sagen: Weislingen hat während seiner Gefangenschaft ihre Liebe gewonnen, um sie angehalten, und ich sagt sie ihm zu. Ich hab’ ihn los gelassen, den Vogel, und er verachtet die gütige Hand, die ihm in der Noth Futter reichte. Er schwirrt herum, weiß Gott auf welcher Hecke seine Nahrung zu suchen.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Sickingen</div> Ist das so?</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Wie ich sage.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Sickingen</div> Er hat ein doppeltes Band zerrissen. Wohl euch, daß ihr mit dem Verräther nicht näher verwandt worden.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Sie sitzt, das arme Mädchen, verjammert und verbetet ihr Leben.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Sickingen</div> Wir wollen sie singen machen.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Wie! Entschließet ihr euch eine Verlaßne zu heirathen.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Sickingen</div> Es macht euch beiden Ehre, von ihm betrogen worden zu sein. Soll darum das arme Mädchen in ein Kloster gehn, weil der erste Mann, den sie kannte, ein Nichtswürdiger war? Nein doch! ich bleibe darauf, sie soll Königin von meinen Schlössern werden.</div>

            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Ich sage euch, sie war nicht gleichgültig gegen ihn.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Sickingen</div> Traust du mir nicht zu, daß ich den Schatten eines Elenden sollte verjagen können? Laß uns zu ihr. (Ab.)</div>

            <div class=env>Hauptmann. Officiere.</div>

            <div class=speech><div class=name>Hauptmann</div> Wir müssen behutsam gehn und unsere Leute so viel möglich schonen. Auch ist unsere gemessene Ordre ihn in die Enge zu treiben und lebendig gefangen zu nehmen. Es wird schwer halten, denn wer mag sich an ihn machen?</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Erster Officier</div> Freilich! Und er wird sich wehren wie ein wildes Schwein. Überhaupt hat er uns sein Lebelang nichts zu Leid’ gethan, und jeder wird’s von sich schieben, Kaiser und Reich zu Gefallen, Arm und Bein daran zu setzen.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Zweiter Officier</div> Es wäre eine Schande wenn wir ihn nicht kriegten. Wenn ich ihn nur einmal bei’m Lappen habe, er soll nicht los kommen.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Erster Officier</div> Faßt ihn nur nicht mit Zähnen, er möchte euch die Kinnbacken ausziehen. Guter junger Herr, dergleichen Leut packen sich nicht wie ein flüchtiger Dieb.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Zweiter Officier</div> Wollen sehn.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Hauptmann</div> Unsern Brief muß er nun haben. Wir wollen nicht säumen, und einen Trupp ausschicken, der ihn beobachten soll.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Zweiter Officier</div> Laßt mich ihn führen.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Hauptmann</div> Ihr seid der Gegend unkundig.</div>

            <div class=env>Sickingen.</div>

            <div class=speech><div class=name>Sickingen</div> Es geht alles nach Wunsch; sie war etwas bestürzt über meinen Antrag, und sah mich vom Kopf bis auf die Füße an; ich wette sie verglich mich mit ihrem Weißfisch. Gott sei Dank, daß ich mich stellen darf. Sie antwortete wenig, und durch einander; desto besser! Es mag eine Zeit kochen. Bei Mädchen, die durch Liebesunglück gebeitzt sind, wird ein Heirathsvorschlag bald gar.</div>

            <div class=env>Götz kommt.</div>

            <div class=speech><div class=name>Sickingen</div> Was bringt ihr, Schwager.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> In die Acht erklärt!</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Sickingen</div> Was?</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Da les’t den erbaulichen Brief. Der Kaiser hat Execution gegen mich verordnet, die mein Fleisch den Vögeln unter dem Himmel und den Thieren auf dem Felde zu fressen vorschneiden soll.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Sickingen</div> Erst sollen sie dran. Just zur gelegenen Zeit bin ich hier.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Nein, Sickingen, ihr sollt fort. Eure großen Anschläge könnten darüber zu Grunde gehn, wenn ihr zu so ungelegner Zeit des Reichs Feind werden wolltet. Auch mir werdet ihr weit mehr nutzen, wenn ihr neutral zu sein scheint. Der Kaiser liebt euch, und das Schlimmste das mir begegnen kann, ist gefangen zu werden; dann braucht euer Vorwort, und reißt mich aus einem Elend, in das unzeitige Hülfe uns beide stürzen könnte. Denn was wär’s? Jetzo geht der Zug gegen mich; erfahren sie du bist bei mir, so schicken sie mehr, und wir sind um nichts gebessert. Der Kaiser sitzt an der Quelle, und ich wär schon jetzt unwiederbringlich verloren, wenn man Tapferkeit so geschwind einblasen könnte, als man einen Haufen zusammen blasen kann.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Sickingen</div> Doch kann ich heimlich ein zwanzig Reiter zu euch stoßen lassen.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Gut. Ich hab schon Georgen nach dem Selbitz geschickt, und meine Knechte in der Nachbarschaft herum. Lieber Schwager, wenn meine Leute beisammen sind, es wird ein Häufchen sein, dergleichen wenig Fürsten beisammen gesehen haben.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Sickingen</div> Ihr werdet gegen die Menge wenig sein.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Ein Wolf ist einer ganzen Heerde Schafe zu viel.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Sickingen</div> Wenn sie aber einen guten Hirten haben?</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Sorg du. Es sind lauter Miethlinge. Und dann kann der beste Ritter nichts machen, wenn er nicht Herr von seinen Handlungen ist. So kamen sie mir auch einmal, wie ich dem Pfalzgrafen zugesagt hatte gegen Conrad Schotten zu dienen; da legt’ er mir einen Zettel aus der Kanzlei vor, wie ich reiten und mich halten sollt; da warf ich den Räthen das Papier wieder dar, und sagt’: ich wüßt nicht darnach zu handlen, ich weiß nicht was mir begegnen mag, das steht nicht im Zettel, ich muß die Augen selbst aufthun, und sehn was ich zu schaffen hab.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Sickingen</div> Glück zu, Bruder! Ich will gleich fort und dir schicken was ich in der Eil zusammen treiben kann.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Komm noch zu den Frauen, ich ließ sie beisammen. Ich wollte daß du ihr Wort hättest ehe du gingst. Dann schick mir die Reiter, und komm heimlich wieder Marien abzuholen, denn mein Schloß, fürcht’ ich, wird bald kein Aufenthalt für Weiber mehr sein.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Sickingen</div> Wollen das Beste hoffen. (Ab.)</div>

            <div class=speech><div class=name>Franz</div> Wozu das? Ich hab’ euch ja gesehen. Ich bin nicht müd noch hungrig.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Adelheid</div> Ich kenne deine Treu.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Franz</div> Ach, gnädige Frau!</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Adelheid</div> Du hältst’s nicht aus, beruhige dich, und nimm was zu dir.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Franz</div> Eure Sorgfalt für einen armen Jungen! (Ab.)</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Adelheid</div> Die Thränen stehn ihm in den Augen. Ich lieb’ ihn von Herzen. So wahr und warm hat noch niemand an mir gehangen. (Ab.)</div>

            <div class=env>Götz. Georg.</div>

            <div class=speech><div class=name>Georg</div> Er will selbst mit euch sprechen. Ich kenn’ ihn nicht; es ist ein stattlicher Mann, mit schwarzen feurigen Augen.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Bring’ ihn herein.</div>

            <div class=env>Lerse kommt.</div>

            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Gott grüß’ euch! Was bringt ihr?</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Lerse</div> Mich selbst, das ist nicht viel, doch alles was es ist biet’ ich euch an.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Ihr seid mir willkommen, doppelt willkommen, ein braver Mann, und zu dieser Zeit, da ich nicht hoffte neue Freunde zu gewinnen, eher den Verlust der alten stündlich fürchtete. Gebt mir euern Namen.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Lerse</div> Franz Lerse.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Ich danke euch, Franz, daß ihr mich mit einem braven Mann bekannt macht.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Lerse</div> Ich machte euch schon einmal mit mir bekannt, aber damals danktet ihr mir nicht dafür.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Ich erinnere mich eurer nicht.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Lerse</div> Es wäre mir leid. Wißt ihr noch, wie ihr um des Pfalzgrafen willen Conrad Schotten feind wart, und nach Haßfurt auf die Fastnacht reiten wolltet?</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Wohl weiß ich es.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Lerse</div> Wißt ihr, wie ihr unterwegs bei einem Dorf fünfundzwanzig Reitern entgegen kamt?</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Richtig. Ich hielt sie anfangs nur für zwölfe, und theilt meinen Haufen, waren unser sechzehn, und hielt am Dorf hinter der Scheuer, in willens sie sollten bei mir vorbeiziehen. Dann wollt’ ich ihnen nachrucken, wie ich’s mit dem andern Haufen abgeredt hatte.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Lerse</div> Aber wir sahn euch, und zogen auf eine Höhe am Dorf. Ihr zogt herbei und hieltet unten. Wie wir sahn ihr wolltet nicht herauf kommen, ritten wir herab.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Da sah ich erst, daß ich mit der Hand in die Kohlen geschlagen hatte. Fünfundzwanzig gegen acht! Da galt’s kein Feiern. Erhard Truchses durchstach mir einen Knecht, dafür rannt’ ich ihn vom Pferde. Hätten sie sich alle gehalten wie er und ein Knecht, es wäre mein und meines kleinen Häufchens übel gewahrt gewesen.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Lerse</div> Der Knecht, wovon ihr sagtet –</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Es war der bravste den ich gesehen habe. Er setzte mir heiß zu. Wenn ich dachte, ich hätt’ ihn von mir gebracht, wollte mit andern zu schaffen haben, war er wieder an mir, und schlug feindlich zu. Er hieb mir auch durch den Panzerärmel hindurch, daß es ein wenig gefleischt hatte.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Lerse</div> Habt ihr’s ihm verziehen?</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Er gefiel mir mehr als zu wohl.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Lerse</div> Nun so hoff’ ich daß ihr mit mir zufrieden sein werdet; ich hab mein Probstück an euch selbst abgelegt.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Bist du’s? O willkommen, willkommen! Kannst du sagen, Maximilian, du hast unter deinen Dienern Einen so geworben!</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Lerse</div> Mich wundert daß ihr nicht eh auf mich gefallen seid.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Wie sollte mir einkommen, daß der mir seine Dienste anbieten würde, der auf das feindseligste mich zu überwältigen trachtete?</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Lerse</div> Eben das, Herr! Von Jugend auf dien’ ich als Reitersknecht, und hab’s mit manchem Ritter aufgenommen. Da wir auf euch stießen, freut’ ich mich. Ich kannte euern Namen, und da lernt’ ich euch kennen. Ihr wißt, ich hielt nicht Stand; ihr saht, es war nicht Furcht, denn ich kam wieder. Kurz ich lernt’ euch kennen, und von Stund an beschloß ich euch zu dienen.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Wie lange wollt ihr bei mir aushalten?</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Lerse</div> Auf ein Jahr. Ohne Entgeld.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Nein, ihr sollt gehalten werden wie ein anderer, und drüber, wie der, der mir bei Remlin zu schaffen machte.</div>


            <div class=env>Georg kommt.</div>

            <div class=speech><div class=name>Georg</div> Hanns von Selbitz läßt euch grüßen. Morgen ist er hier mit funfzig Mann.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Wohl.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Georg</div> Es zieht am Kocher ein Trupp Reichsvölker herunter; ohne Zweifel euch zu beobachten.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Wie viel?</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Georg</div> Ihrer funfzig.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Nicht mehr! Komm, Lerse, wir wollen sie zusammenschmeißen, wenn Selbitz kommt daß er schon ein Stück Arbeit gethan findet.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Lerse</div> Das soll eine reichliche Vorlese werden.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Zu Pferde! (Ab.)</div>

            <div class=env>Wald an einem Morast.</div>

            <div class=env>Zwei Reichsknechte begegnen einander.</div>

            <div class=speech><div class=name>Erster Knecht</div> Was machst du hier?</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Zweiter Knecht</div> Ich hab’ Urlaub gebeten meine Nothdurft zu verrichten. Seit dem blinden Lärmen gestern Abends ist mir’s in die Gedärme geschlagen, daß ich alle Augenblicke vom Pferd muß.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Erster Knecht</div> Hält der Trupp hier in der Nähe?</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Zweiter Knecht</div> Wohl eine Stunde den Wald hinauf.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Erster Knecht</div> Wie verläufst du dich denn hieher?</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Zweiter Knecht</div> Ich bitte dich verrath mich nicht. Ich will auf’s nächste Dorf, und sehn ob ich nit mit warmen Überschlägen meinem Übel abhelfen kann. Wo kommst du her?</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Erster Knecht</div> Vom nächsten Dorf. Ich hab’ unserm Officier Wein und Brot geholt.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Zweiter Knecht</div> So, er thut sich was zu Gut vor unserm Angesicht, und wir sollen fasten! Schön Exempel!</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Erster Knecht</div> Komm mit zurück, Schurke.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Zweiter Knecht</div> Wär’ ich ein Narr! Es sind noch viele unter’m Haufen, die gern fasteten, wenn sie so weit davon wären als ich.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Erster Knecht</div> Hörst du! Pferde!</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Zweiter Knecht</div> O weh!</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Erster Knecht</div> Ich klettere auf den Baum.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Zweiter Knecht</div> Ich steck mich in’s Rohr.</div>

<div id="goethe3_intence">


            <div class=env>Götz, Lerse, Georg, Knechte zu Pferde.</div>

            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Hier am Teich weg und linker Hand in den Wald, so kommen wir ihnen in Rücken.</div>

            <div class=env>Sie ziehen vorbei.</div>

            <div class=speech><div class=name>Erster Knecht (steigt vom Baum)</div> Da ist nicht gut sein. Michel! Er antwortet nicht? Michel, sie sind fort! (Er geht nach dem Sumpf.) Michel!

            <div class=env>Götz, Georg zu Pferde.</div>

            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Halt Kerl, oder du bist des Todes!</div>

            <div class=speech><div class=name>Knecht</div> Was ist aus unserm Ritter geworden der uns führte?</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Georg</div> Unterst zu oberst stürzt’ ihn mein Herr vom Pferd, daß der Federbusch im Koth stak. Seine Reiter huben ihn auf’s Pferd und fort, wie besessen. (Ab.)</div>

            <div class=env>Hauptmann. Erster Ritter.</div>

            <div class=speech><div class=name>Hauptmann</div> Er wird ihnen an den Fersen sein. Laßt ein funfzig ausrücken bis an die Mühle; wenn er sich zu weit verliert, erwischt ihr ihn vielleicht. (Ritter ab.)</div>

            <div class=env>Zweiter Ritter geführt.</div>

            <div class=speech><div class=name>Hauptmann</div> Wie geht’s junger Herr? Habt ihr ein paar Zinken abgerennt?</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Ritter</div> Daß dich die Pest! Das stärkste Geweih wäre gesplittert wie Glas. Du Teufel! Er rannt’ auf mich los, es war mir als wenn mich der Donner in die Erd’ hinein schlüg.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Hauptmann</div> Dankt Gott daß ihr noch davon gekommen seid.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Ritter</div> Es ist nichts zu danken, ein paar Rippen sind entzwei. Wo ist der Feldscher? (Ab.)</div>

            <div class=speech><div class=name>Selbitz</div> Es ist ein Streich von Weislingen.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Meinst du?</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Selbitz</div> Ich meine nicht, ich weiß.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Woher?</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Selbitz</div> Er war auf dem Reichstag, sag’ ich dir, er war um den Kaiser.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Wohl, so machen wir ihm wieder einen Anschlag zu nichte.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Selbitz</div> Hoff’s.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Wir wollen fort! und soll die Hasenjagd angehn.</div>

            <div class=env>Lager.</div>
            <div class=env>Hauptmann. Ritter.</div>

            <div class=speech><div class=name>Hauptmann</div> Dabei kommt nichts heraus, ihr Herrn. Er schlägt uns einen Haufen nach dem andern, und was nicht umkommt und gefangen wird, das läuft in Gottes Namen lieber nach der Türkei als in’s Lager zurück. So werden wir alle Tag schwächer. Wir müssen einmal für allemal ihm zu Leib gehen, und das mit Ernst; ich will selbst dabei sein, und er soll sehn mit wem er zu thun hat.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Ritter</div> Wir sind’s all zufrieden; nur ist er der Landsart so kundig, weiß alle Gänge und Schliche im Gebirg, daß er so wenig zu fangen ist wie eine Maus auf dem Kornboden.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Hauptmann</div> Wollen ihn schon kriegen. Erst auf Jaxthausen zu. Mag er wollen oder nicht, er muß herbei sein Schloß zu vertheidigen.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Ritter</div> Soll unser ganzer Hauf marschiren?</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Hauptmann</div> Freilich! Wißt ihr daß wir schon um hundert geschmolzen sind?</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Ritter</div> Drum geschwind, eh der ganze Eisklumpen aufthaut; es macht warm in der Nähe, und wir stehn da wie Butter an der Sonne. (Ab.)</div>


            <div class=env>Gebirg und Wald.</div>
            <div class=env>Götz. Selbitz. Trupp.</div>

            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Sie kommen mit hellem Hauf. Es war hohe Zeit daß Sickingens Reiter zu uns stießen.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Selbitz</div> Wir wollen uns theilen. Ich will linker Hand um die Höhe ziehen.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Gut. Und du, Franz, führe mir die funfzig rechts durch den Wald hinauf; sie kommen über die Heide, ich will gegen ihnen halten. Georg, du bleibst um mich. Und wenn ihr seht daß sie mich angreifen, so fallt ungesäumt in die Seiten. Wir wollen sie patschen. Sie denken nicht daß wir ihnen die Spitze bieten können. (Ab.)</div>

            <div class=env>Heide, auf der einen Seite eine Höhe, auf der andern Wald.</div>
            <div class=env>Hauptmann. Executionszug.</div>

            <div class=speech><div class=name>Hauptmann</div> Er hält auf der Heide! Das ist impertinent. Er soll’s büßen. Was! Den Strom nicht zu fürchten der auf ihn losbraus’t?</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Ritter</div> Ich wollt nicht daß ihr an der Spitze rittet; er hat das Ansehn als ob er den Ersten, der ihn anstoßen möchte, umgekehrt in die Erde pflanzen wollte. Reitet hinter drein.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Hauptmann</div> Nicht gern.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Ritter</div> Ich bitt’ euch. Ihr seid noch der Knoten von diesem Bündel Haselruthen; lös’t ihn auf, so knickt er sie euch einzeln wie Rietgras.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Hauptmann</div> Trompeter, blas’! Und ihr blas’t ihn weg. (Ab.)</div>

            <div class=env>Selbitz hinter der Höhe hervor im Galop.</div>

            <div class=speech><div class=name>Selbitz</div> Mir nach! Sie sollen zu ihren Händen rufen: multiplicirt euch. (Ab.)</div>

            <div class=env>Lerse aus dem Wald.</div>

            <div class=speech><div class=name>Lerse</div> Götzen zu Hülf! Er ist fast umringt. Braver Selbitz, du hast schon Luft gemacht. Wir wollen die Heide mit ihren Distelköpfen besäen. (Vorbei. Getümmel.)</div>

            <div class=speech><div class=name>Knecht</div> Gut. – Da flieht Einer nach dem Wald. Noch Einer! Ein ganzer Trupp! Götz ist hin.</div>

            <div class=speech><div class=name>Selbitz</div> Du lebst und siegst! Ich habe wenig gethan. Und meine Hunde von Reitern! Wie bist du davon gekommen?</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Dießmal galt’s! Und hier Georgen dank’ ich das Leben, und hier Lersen dank’ ich’s. Ich warf den Hauptmann vom Gaul. Sie stachen mein Pferd nieder und drangen auf mich ein. Georg hieb sich zu mir und sprang ab, ich wie der Blitz auf seinen Gaul, wie der Donner saß er auch wieder. Wie kamst du zum Pferd?</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Georg</div> Einem, der nach euch hieb, stieß ich meinen Dolch in die Gedärme, wie sich sein Harnisch in die Höhe zog. Er stürzt’, und ich half euch von einem Feind und mir zu einem Pferde.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Nun staken wir, bis sich Franz zu uns hereinschlug, und da mähten wir von innen heraus.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Lerse</div> Die Hunde die ich führte sollten von außen hinein mähen bis sich unsere Sensen begegnet hätten; aber sie flohen wie Reichsknechte.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Es flohe Freund und Feind. Nur du kleiner Hauf hieltest mir den Rücken frei; ich hatte mit den Kerls vor mir genug zu thun. Der Fall ihres Hauptmanns half mir sie schütteln und sie flohen. Ich habe ihre Fahne und wenig Gefangene.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Selbitz</div> Der Hauptmann ist euch entwischt?</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Sie hatten ihn inzwischen gerettet. Kommt, Kinder! kommt, Selbitz! – Macht eine Bahre von Ästen; – du kannst nicht auf’s Pferd. Komm in mein Schloß. Sie sind zerstreut. Aber unser sind wenig, und ich weiß nicht ob sie Truppen nachzuschicken haben. Ich will euch bewirthen, meine Freunde.

Es wird’s niemand glauben, als wer über uns zu lachen Lust hat. – Reit herum, ihr, und ihr, und ihr. Wo ihr von unsern zerstreuten Knechten findt, bringt sie zurück oder stecht sie nieder.

            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Wir dürfen keinen Augenblick säumen! Arme Jungen, ich darf euch keine Rast gönnen. Jagt geschwind herum und sucht noch Reiter aufzutreiben. Bestellt sie alle nach Weilern, da sind sie am sichersten. Wenn wir zögern, so ziehen sie mir vor’s Schloß. (Die Zwei ab.) Ich muß einen auf Kundschaft ausjagen. Es fängt an heiß zu werden, und wenn es nur noch brave Kerls wären! aber so ist’s die Menge. (Ab.)</div>

            <div class=env>Sickingen. Maria.</div>

            <div class=speech><div class=name>Maria</div> Ich bitte euch, lieber Sickingen, geht nicht von meinem Bruder! Seine Reiter, Selbitzens, eure, sind zerstreut; er ist allein, Selbitz ist verwundet auf sein Schloß gebracht, und ich fürchte alles.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Sickingen</div> Seid ruhig, ich gehe nicht weg.</div>

            <div class=env>Götz kommt.</div>

            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Kommt in die Kirch, der Pater wartet. Ihr sollt mir in einer Viertelstund ein Paar sein.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Sickingen</div> Laßt mich hier.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> In die Kirch sollt ihr jetzt.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Sickingen</div> Gern – und darnach?</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Darnach sollt ihr eurer Wege gehn.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Sickingen</div> Götz!</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Wollt ihr nicht in die Kirche?</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Sickingen</div> Kommt, kommt.</div>

            <div class=speech><div class=name>Ritter</div> Hundert und funfzig.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Hauptmann</div> Von Vierhunderten! Das ist arg. Jetzt gleich auf und grad gegen Jaxthausen zu, eh er sich wieder erholt und sich uns wieder in Weg stellt.</div>

            <div class=env>Augsburg. Ein Garten.</div>

            <div class=env>Zwei Nürnberger Kaufleute.</div>

            <div class=speech><div class=name>Erster Kaufmann</div> Hier wollen wir stehn, denn da muß der Kaiser vorbei. Er kommt eben den langen Gang herauf.</div>

            <div class=speech><div class=name>Zweiter Kaufmann</div> Wer ist bei ihm?</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Erster Kaufmann</div> Adelbert von Weislingen!</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Zweiter Kaufmann</div> Bambergs Freund! Das ist gut.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Erster Kaufmann</div> Wir wollen einen Fußfall thun, und ich will reden.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Zweiter Kaufmann</div> Wohl, da kommen sie.</div>

            <div class=env>Kaiser. Weislingen.</div>

            <div class=speech><div class=name>Erster Kaufmann</div> Er sieht verdrießlich aus.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Kaiser</div> Ich bin unmuthig, Weislingen, und wenn ich auf mein vergangenes Leben zurück sehe, möcht’ ich verzagt werden; so viel halbe, so viel verunglückte Unternehmungen! und das alles, weil kein Fürst im Reich so klein ist, dem nicht mehr an seinen Grillen gelegen wäre als an meinen Gedanken.</div>

            <div class=env>Die Kaufleute werfen sich ihm zu Füßen.</div>

            <div class=speech><div class=name>Kaufmann</div> Allerdurchlauchtigster! Großmächtigster!</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Kaiser</div> Wer seid ihr? Was gibt’s?</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Kaufmann</div> Arme Kaufleute von Nürnberg, Eurer Majestät Knechte, und flehen um Hülfe. Götz von Berlichingen und Hanns von Selbitz haben unser dreißig, die von der Frankfurter Messe kamen, im Bambergischen Geleite niedergeworfen und beraubt; wir bitten Eure Kaiserliche Majestät um Hülfe, um Beistand, sonst sind wir alle verdorbene Leute, genöthigt unser Brot zu betteln.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Kaiser</div> Heiliger Gott! Heiliger Gott! Was ist das? Der eine hat nur Eine Hand, der andere nur Ein Bein; wenn sie denn erst zwei Hände hätten, und zwei Beine, was wolltet ihr dann thun?</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Kaufmann</div> Wir bitten Eure Majestät unterthänigst, auf unsere bedrängten Umstände ein mitleidiges Auge zu werfen.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Kaiser</div> Wie geht’s zu! Wenn ein Kaufmann einen Pfeffersack verliert, soll man das ganze Reich aufmahnen; und wenn Händel vorhanden sind, daran Kaiserlicher Majestät und dem Reich viel gelegen ist, daß es Königreich, Fürstenthum, Herzogthum und anders betrifft, so kann euch kein Mensch zusammen bringen.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Weislingen</div> Ihr kommt zur ungelegnen Zeit. Geht und verweilt einige Tage hier.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Kaufleute</div> Wir empfehlen uns zu Gnaden. (Ab.)</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Kaiser</div> Wieder neue Händel. Sie wachsen nach wie die Köpfe der Hydra.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Weislingen</div> Und sind nicht auszurotten als mit Feuer und Schwert, und einer muthigen Unternehmung.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Kaiser</div> Glaubt ihr?</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Weislingen</div> Ich halte nichts für thunlicher, wenn Eure Majestät und die Fürsten sich über andern unbedeutenden Zwist vereinigen könnten. Es ist mit nichten ganz Deutschland, das über Beunruhigung klagt. Franken und Schwaben allein glimmt noch von den Resten des innerlichen verderblichen Bürgerkriegs. Und auch da sind viele der Edeln und Freien, die sich nach Ruhe sehnen. Hätten wir einmal diesen Sickingen, Selbitz – Berlichingen auf die Seite geschafft, das Übrige würde bald von sich selbst zerfallen. Denn sie sind’s, deren Geist die aufrührische Menge belebt.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Kaiser</div> Ich möchte die Leute gerne schonen, sie sind tapfer und edel. Wenn ich Krieg führte, müßten sie mit mir zu Felde.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Weislingen</div> Es wäre zu wünschen, daß sie von jeher gelernt hätten ihrer Pflicht zu gehorchen. Und dann wär’ es höchst gefährlich ihre aufrührischen Unternehmungen durch Ehrenstellen zu belohnen. Denn eben diese Kaiserliche Mild’ und Gnade ist’s, die sie bisher so ungeheuer mißbrauchten, und ihr Anhang, der sein Vertrauen und Hoffnung darauf setzt, wird nicht ehe zu bändigen sein, bis wir sie ganz vor den Augen der Welt zu nichte gemacht, und ihnen alle Hoffnung jemals wieder empor zu kommen völlig abgeschnitten haben.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Kaiser</div> Ihr rathet also zur Strenge?</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Weislingen</div> Ich sehe kein ander Mittel, den Schwindelgeist, der ganze Landschaften ergreift, zu bannen. Hören wir nicht schon hier und da die bittersten Klagen der Edeln, daß ihre Unterthanen, ihre Leibeignen sich gegen sie auflehnen und mit ihnen rechten, ihnen die hergebrachte Oberherrschaft zu schmälern drohen, so daß die gefährlichsten Folgen zu fürchten sind?</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Kaiser</div> Jetzt wär’ eine schöne Gelegenheit wider den Berlichingen und Selbitz; nur wollt’ ich nicht daß ihnen was zu Leid’ geschehe. Gefangen möcht’ ich sie haben, und dann müßten sie Urfehde schwören, auf ihren Schlössern ruhig zu bleiben, und nicht aus ihrem Bann zu gehen. Bei der nächsten Session will ich’s vortragen.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Weislingen</div> Ein freudiger beistimmender Zuruf wird Eurer Majestät das Ende der Rede ersparen. (Ab.)</div>

            <div class=env>Sickingen. Berlichingen.</div>

            <div class=speech><div class=name>Sickingen</div> Ja, ich komme eure edle Schwester um ihr Herz und ihre Hand zu bitten.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> So wollt’ ich ihr wärt eher kommen. Ich muß euch sagen: Weislingen hat während seiner Gefangenschaft ihre Liebe gewonnen, um sie angehalten, und ich sagt sie ihm zu. Ich hab’ ihn los gelassen, den Vogel, und er verachtet die gütige Hand, die ihm in der Noth Futter reichte. Er schwirrt herum, weiß Gott auf welcher Hecke seine Nahrung zu suchen.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Sickingen</div> Ist das so?</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Wie ich sage.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Sickingen</div> Er hat ein doppeltes Band zerrissen. Wohl euch, daß ihr mit dem Verräther nicht näher verwandt worden.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Sie sitzt, das arme Mädchen, verjammert und verbetet ihr Leben.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Sickingen</div> Wir wollen sie singen machen.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Wie! Entschließet ihr euch eine Verlaßne zu heirathen.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Sickingen</div> Es macht euch beiden Ehre, von ihm betrogen worden zu sein. Soll darum das arme Mädchen in ein Kloster gehn, weil der erste Mann, den sie kannte, ein Nichtswürdiger war? Nein doch! ich bleibe darauf, sie soll Königin von meinen Schlössern werden.</div>

            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Ich sage euch, sie war nicht gleichgültig gegen ihn.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Sickingen</div> Traust du mir nicht zu, daß ich den Schatten eines Elenden sollte verjagen können? Laß uns zu ihr. (Ab.)</div>

            <div class=env>Hauptmann. Officiere.</div>

            <div class=speech><div class=name>Hauptmann</div> Wir müssen behutsam gehn und unsere Leute so viel möglich schonen. Auch ist unsere gemessene Ordre ihn in die Enge zu treiben und lebendig gefangen zu nehmen. Es wird schwer halten, denn wer mag sich an ihn machen?</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Erster Officier</div> Freilich! Und er wird sich wehren wie ein wildes Schwein. Überhaupt hat er uns sein Lebelang nichts zu Leid’ gethan, und jeder wird’s von sich schieben, Kaiser und Reich zu Gefallen, Arm und Bein daran zu setzen.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Zweiter Officier</div> Es wäre eine Schande wenn wir ihn nicht kriegten. Wenn ich ihn nur einmal bei’m Lappen habe, er soll nicht los kommen.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Erster Officier</div> Faßt ihn nur nicht mit Zähnen, er möchte euch die Kinnbacken ausziehen. Guter junger Herr, dergleichen Leut packen sich nicht wie ein flüchtiger Dieb.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Zweiter Officier</div> Wollen sehn.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Hauptmann</div> Unsern Brief muß er nun haben. Wir wollen nicht säumen, und einen Trupp ausschicken, der ihn beobachten soll.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Zweiter Officier</div> Laßt mich ihn führen.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Hauptmann</div> Ihr seid der Gegend unkundig.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Zweiter Officier</div> Ich hab’ einen Knecht, der hier geboren und erzogen ist.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Hauptmann</div> Ich bin’s zufrieden. (Ab.)</div>



            <div class=env>Jaxthausen.</div>
            <div class=env>Sickingen.</div>

            <div class=speech><div class=name>Sickingen</div> Es geht alles nach Wunsch; sie war etwas bestürzt über meinen Antrag, und sah mich vom Kopf bis auf die Füße an; ich wette sie verglich mich mit ihrem Weißfisch. Gott sei Dank, daß ich mich stellen darf. Sie antwortete wenig, und durch einander; desto besser! Es mag eine Zeit kochen. Bei Mädchen, die durch Liebesunglück gebeitzt sind, wird ein Heirathsvorschlag bald gar.</div>

            <div class=env>Götz kommt.</div>

            <div class=speech><div class=name>Sickingen</div> Was bringt ihr, Schwager.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> In die Acht erklärt!</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Sickingen</div> Was?</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Da les’t den erbaulichen Brief. Der Kaiser hat Execution gegen mich verordnet, die mein Fleisch den Vögeln unter dem Himmel und den Thieren auf dem Felde zu fressen vorschneiden soll.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Sickingen</div> Erst sollen sie dran. Just zur gelegenen Zeit bin ich hier.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Nein, Sickingen, ihr sollt fort. Eure großen Anschläge könnten darüber zu Grunde gehn, wenn ihr zu so ungelegner Zeit des Reichs Feind werden wolltet. Auch mir werdet ihr weit mehr nutzen, wenn ihr neutral zu sein scheint. Der Kaiser liebt euch, und das Schlimmste das mir begegnen kann, ist gefangen zu werden; dann braucht euer Vorwort, und reißt mich aus einem Elend, in das unzeitige Hülfe uns beide stürzen könnte. Denn was wär’s? Jetzo geht der Zug gegen mich; erfahren sie du bist bei mir, so schicken sie mehr, und wir sind um nichts gebessert. Der Kaiser sitzt an der Quelle, und ich wär schon jetzt unwiederbringlich verloren, wenn man Tapferkeit so geschwind einblasen könnte, als man einen Haufen zusammen blasen kann.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Sickingen</div> Doch kann ich heimlich ein zwanzig Reiter zu euch stoßen lassen.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Gut. Ich hab schon Georgen nach dem Selbitz geschickt, und meine Knechte in der Nachbarschaft herum. Lieber Schwager, wenn meine Leute beisammen sind, es wird ein Häufchen sein, dergleichen wenig Fürsten beisammen gesehen haben.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Sickingen</div> Ihr werdet gegen die Menge wenig sein.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Ein Wolf ist einer ganzen Heerde Schafe zu viel.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Sickingen</div> Wenn sie aber einen guten Hirten haben?</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Sorg du. Es sind lauter Miethlinge. Und dann kann der beste Ritter nichts machen, wenn er nicht Herr von seinen Handlungen ist. So kamen sie mir auch einmal, wie ich dem Pfalzgrafen zugesagt hatte gegen Conrad Schotten zu dienen; da legt’ er mir einen Zettel aus der Kanzlei vor, wie ich reiten und mich halten sollt; da warf ich den Räthen das Papier wieder dar, und sagt’: ich wüßt nicht darnach zu handlen, ich weiß nicht was mir begegnen mag, das steht nicht im Zettel, ich muß die Augen selbst aufthun, und sehn was ich zu schaffen hab.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Sickingen</div> Glück zu, Bruder! Ich will gleich fort und dir schicken was ich in der Eil zusammen treiben kann.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Komm noch zu den Frauen, ich ließ sie beisammen. Ich wollte daß du ihr Wort hättest ehe du gingst. Dann schick mir die Reiter, und komm heimlich wieder Marien abzuholen, denn mein Schloß, fürcht’ ich, wird bald kein Aufenthalt für Weiber mehr sein.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Sickingen</div> Wollen das Beste hoffen. (Ab.)</div>

            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Bring’ ihn herein.</div>

            <div class=env>Lerse kommt.</div>

            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Gott grüß’ euch! Was bringt ihr?</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Lerse</div> Mich selbst, das ist nicht viel, doch alles was es ist biet’ ich euch an.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Ihr seid mir willkommen, doppelt willkommen, ein braver Mann, und zu dieser Zeit, da ich nicht hoffte neue Freunde zu gewinnen, eher den Verlust der alten stündlich fürchtete. Gebt mir euern Namen.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Lerse</div> Franz Lerse.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Ich danke euch, Franz, daß ihr mich mit einem braven Mann bekannt macht.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Lerse</div> Ich machte euch schon einmal mit mir bekannt, aber damals danktet ihr mir nicht dafür.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Ich erinnere mich eurer nicht.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Lerse</div> Es wäre mir leid. Wißt ihr noch, wie ihr um des Pfalzgrafen willen Conrad Schotten feind wart, und nach Haßfurt auf die Fastnacht reiten wolltet?</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Wohl weiß ich es.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Lerse</div> Wißt ihr, wie ihr unterwegs bei einem Dorf fünfundzwanzig Reitern entgegen kamt?</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Richtig. Ich hielt sie anfangs nur für zwölfe, und theilt meinen Haufen, waren unser sechzehn, und hielt am Dorf hinter der Scheuer, in willens sie sollten bei mir vorbeiziehen. Dann wollt’ ich ihnen nachrucken, wie ich’s mit dem andern Haufen abgeredt hatte.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Lerse</div> Aber wir sahn euch, und zogen auf eine Höhe am Dorf. Ihr zogt herbei und hieltet unten. Wie wir sahn ihr wolltet nicht herauf kommen, ritten wir herab.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Da sah ich erst, daß ich mit der Hand in die Kohlen geschlagen hatte. Fünfundzwanzig gegen acht! Da galt’s kein Feiern. Erhard Truchses durchstach mir einen Knecht, dafür rannt’ ich ihn vom Pferde. Hätten sie sich alle gehalten wie er und ein Knecht, es wäre mein und meines kleinen Häufchens übel gewahrt gewesen.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Lerse</div> Der Knecht, wovon ihr sagtet –</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Es war der bravste den ich gesehen habe. Er setzte mir heiß zu. Wenn ich dachte, ich hätt’ ihn von mir gebracht, wollte mit andern zu schaffen haben, war er wieder an mir, und schlug feindlich zu. Er hieb mir auch durch den Panzerärmel hindurch, daß es ein wenig gefleischt hatte.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Lerse</div> Habt ihr’s ihm verziehen?</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Er gefiel mir mehr als zu wohl.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Lerse</div> Nun so hoff’ ich daß ihr mit mir zufrieden sein werdet; ich hab mein Probstück an euch selbst abgelegt.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Bist du’s? O willkommen, willkommen! Kannst du sagen, Maximilian, du hast unter deinen Dienern Einen so geworben!</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Lerse</div> Mich wundert daß ihr nicht eh auf mich gefallen seid.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Wie sollte mir einkommen, daß der mir seine Dienste anbieten würde, der auf das feindseligste mich zu überwältigen trachtete?</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Lerse</div> Eben das, Herr! Von Jugend auf dien’ ich als Reitersknecht, und hab’s mit manchem Ritter aufgenommen. Da wir auf euch stießen, freut’ ich mich. Ich kannte euern Namen, und da lernt’ ich euch kennen. Ihr wißt, ich hielt nicht Stand; ihr saht, es war nicht Furcht, denn ich kam wieder. Kurz ich lernt’ euch kennen, und von Stund an beschloß ich euch zu dienen.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Wie lange wollt ihr bei mir aushalten?</div>

            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Nein, ihr sollt gehalten werden wie ein anderer, und drüber, wie der, der mir bei Remlin zu schaffen machte.</div>



            <div class=env>Georg kommt.</div>

            <div class=speech><div class=name>Georg</div> Hanns von Selbitz läßt euch grüßen. Morgen ist er hier mit funfzig Mann.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Wohl.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Georg</div> Es zieht am Kocher ein Trupp Reichsvölker herunter; ohne Zweifel euch zu beobachten.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Wie viel?</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Georg</div> Ihrer funfzig.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Nicht mehr! Komm, Lerse, wir wollen sie zusammenschmeißen, wenn Selbitz kommt daß er schon ein Stück Arbeit gethan findet.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Lerse</div> Das soll eine reichliche Vorlese werden.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Zu Pferde! (Ab.)</div>

            <div class=env>Wald an einem Morast.</div>

            <div class=env>Zwei Reichsknechte begegnen einander.</div>

            <div class=speech><div class=name>Erster Knecht</div> Was machst du hier?</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Zweiter Knecht</div> Ich hab’ Urlaub gebeten meine Nothdurft zu verrichten. Seit dem blinden Lärmen gestern Abends ist mir’s in die Gedärme geschlagen, daß ich alle Augenblicke vom Pferd muß.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Erster Knecht</div> Hält der Trupp hier in der Nähe?</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Zweiter Knecht</div> Wohl eine Stunde den Wald hinauf.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Erster Knecht</div> Wie verläufst du dich denn hieher?</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Zweiter Knecht</div> Ich bitte dich verrath mich nicht. Ich will auf’s nächste Dorf, und sehn ob ich nit mit warmen Überschlägen meinem Übel abhelfen kann. Wo kommst du her?</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Erster Knecht</div> Vom nächsten Dorf. Ich hab’ unserm Officier Wein und Brot geholt.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Zweiter Knecht</div> So, er thut sich was zu Gut vor unserm Angesicht, und wir sollen fasten! Schön Exempel!</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Erster Knecht</div> Komm mit zurück, Schurke.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Zweiter Knecht</div> Wär’ ich ein Narr! Es sind noch viele unter’m Haufen, die gern fasteten, wenn sie so weit davon wären als ich.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Erster Knecht</div> Hörst du! Pferde!</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Zweiter Knecht</div> O weh!</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Erster Knecht</div> Ich klettere auf den Baum.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Zweiter Knecht</div> Ich steck mich in’s Rohr.</div>

</div>
<div id="goethe3_bar">

            <div class=env>Götz, Lerse, Georg, Knechte zu Pferde.</div>

            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Hier am Teich weg und linker Hand in den Wald, so kommen wir ihnen in Rücken.</div>

            <div class=env>Sie ziehen vorbei.</div>

            <div class=speech><div class=name>Erster Knecht (steigt vom Baum)</div> Da ist nicht gut sein. Michel! Er antwortet nicht? Michel, sie sind fort! (Er geht nach dem Sumpf.) Michel!

            <div class=env>Götz, Georg zu Pferde.</div>

            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Halt Kerl, oder du bist des Todes!</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Knecht</div> Schont meines Lebens!</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Dein Schwert! Georg, führ’ ihn zu den andern Gefangenen, die Lerse dort unten am Wald hat. Ich muß ihren flüchtigen Führer erreichen. (Ab.)</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Knecht</div> Was ist aus unserm Ritter geworden der uns führte?</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Georg</div> Unterst zu oberst stürzt’ ihn mein Herr vom Pferd, daß der Federbusch im Koth stak. Seine Reiter huben ihn auf’s Pferd und fort, wie besessen. (Ab.)</div>


            <div class=env>Lager.</div>

            <div class=env>Hauptmann. Erster Ritter.</div>

            <div class=speech><div class=name>Erster Ritter</div> Sie fliehen von weitem dem Lager zu.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Hauptmann</div> Er wird ihnen an den Fersen sein. Laßt ein funfzig ausrücken bis an die Mühle; wenn er sich zu weit verliert, erwischt ihr ihn vielleicht. (Ritter ab.)</div>

            <div class=env>Zweiter Ritter geführt.</div>

            <div class=speech><div class=name>Hauptmann</div> Wie geht’s junger Herr? Habt ihr ein paar Zinken abgerennt?</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Ritter</div> Daß dich die Pest! Das stärkste Geweih wäre gesplittert wie Glas. Du Teufel! Er rannt’ auf mich los, es war mir als wenn mich der Donner in die Erd’ hinein schlüg.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Hauptmann</div> Dankt Gott daß ihr noch davon gekommen seid.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Ritter</div> Es ist nichts zu danken, ein paar Rippen sind entzwei. Wo ist der Feldscher? (Ab.)</div>

            <div class=env>Jaxthausen.</div>
            <div class=env>Götz.Selbitz.</div>

            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Was sagst du zu der Achtserklärung, Selbitz?</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Selbitz</div> Es ist ein Streich von Weislingen.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Meinst du?</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Selbitz</div> Ich meine nicht, ich weiß.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Woher?</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Selbitz</div> Er war auf dem Reichstag, sag’ ich dir, er war um den Kaiser.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Wohl, so machen wir ihm wieder einen Anschlag zu nichte.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Selbitz</div> Hoff’s.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Wir wollen fort! und soll die Hasenjagd angehn.</div>

            <div class=env>Lager.</div>
            <div class=env>Hauptmann. Ritter.</div>

            <div class=speech><div class=name>Hauptmann</div> Dabei kommt nichts heraus, ihr Herrn. Er schlägt uns einen Haufen nach dem andern, und was nicht umkommt und gefangen wird, das läuft in Gottes Namen lieber nach der Türkei als in’s Lager zurück. So werden wir alle Tag schwächer. Wir müssen einmal für allemal ihm zu Leib gehen, und das mit Ernst; ich will selbst dabei sein, und er soll sehn mit wem er zu thun hat.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Ritter</div> Wir sind’s all zufrieden; nur ist er der Landsart so kundig, weiß alle Gänge und Schliche im Gebirg, daß er so wenig zu fangen ist wie eine Maus auf dem Kornboden.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Hauptmann</div> Wollen ihn schon kriegen. Erst auf Jaxthausen zu. Mag er wollen oder nicht, er muß herbei sein Schloß zu vertheidigen.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Ritter</div> Soll unser ganzer Hauf marschiren?</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Hauptmann</div> Freilich! Wißt ihr daß wir schon um hundert geschmolzen sind?</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Ritter</div> Drum geschwind, eh der ganze Eisklumpen aufthaut; es macht warm in der Nähe, und wir stehn da wie Butter an der Sonne. (Ab.)</div>


            <div class=env>Gebirg und Wald.</div>
            <div class=env>Götz. Selbitz. Trupp.</div>

            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Sie kommen mit hellem Hauf. Es war hohe Zeit daß Sickingens Reiter zu uns stießen.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Selbitz</div> Wir wollen uns theilen. Ich will linker Hand um die Höhe ziehen.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Gut. Und du, Franz, führe mir die funfzig rechts durch den Wald hinauf; sie kommen über die Heide, ich will gegen ihnen halten. Georg, du bleibst um mich. Und wenn ihr seht daß sie mich angreifen, so fallt ungesäumt in die Seiten. Wir wollen sie patschen. Sie denken nicht daß wir ihnen die Spitze bieten können. (Ab.)</div>

            <div class=env>Heide, auf der einen Seite eine Höhe, auf der andern Wald.</div>
            <div class=env>Hauptmann. Executionszug.</div>

            <div class=speech><div class=name>Hauptmann</div> Er hält auf der Heide! Das ist impertinent. Er soll’s büßen. Was! Den Strom nicht zu fürchten der auf ihn losbraus’t?</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Ritter</div> Ich wollt nicht daß ihr an der Spitze rittet; er hat das Ansehn als ob er den Ersten, der ihn anstoßen möchte, umgekehrt in die Erde pflanzen wollte. Reitet hinter drein.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Hauptmann</div> Nicht gern.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Ritter</div> Ich bitt’ euch. Ihr seid noch der Knoten von diesem Bündel Haselruthen; lös’t ihn auf, so knickt er sie euch einzeln wie Rietgras.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Hauptmann</div> Trompeter, blas’! Und ihr blas’t ihn weg. (Ab.)</div>

            <div class=env>Selbitz hinter der Höhe hervor im Galop.</div>

            <div class=speech><div class=name>Selbitz</div> Mir nach! Sie sollen zu ihren Händen rufen: multiplicirt euch. (Ab.)</div>

            <div class=env>Lerse aus dem Wald.</div>

            <div class=speech><div class=name>Lerse</div> Götzen zu Hülf! Er ist fast umringt. Braver Selbitz, du hast schon Luft gemacht. Wir wollen die Heide mit ihren Distelköpfen besäen. (Vorbei. Getümmel.)</div>

            <div class=env>Eine Höhe mit einem Wartthurn.</div>
            <div class=env>Selbitz verwundet. Knechte.</div>

            <div class=speech><div class=name>Selbitz</div> Legt mich hieher und kehrt zu Götzen.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Erster Knecht</div> Laßt uns bleiben, Herr, ihr braucht unser.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Selbitz</div> Steig’ einer auf die Warte und seh wie’s geht.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Erster Knecht</div> Wie will ich hinauf kommen?</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Zweiter Knecht</div> Steig’ auf meine Schultern, da kannst du die Lücke reichen und dir bis zur Öffnung hinauf helfen.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Erster Knecht (steigt hinauf)</div> Ach, Herr!</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Selbitz</div> Was siehest du?</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Erster Knecht</div> Eure Reiter fliehen der Höhe zu.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Selbitz</div> Höllische Schurken! Ich wollt sie stünden und ich hätt’ eine Kugel vor’m Kopf. Reit’ einer hin! und fluch’ und wetter sie zurück. (Knecht ab.) Siehest du Götzen?</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Knecht</div> Die drei schwarzen Federn seh’ ich mitten im Getümmel.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Selbitz</div> Schwimm, braver Schwimmer. Ich liege hier!</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Knecht</div> Ein weißer Federbusch, wer ist das?</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Selbitz</div> Der Hauptmann.</div>

            <div class=speech><div class=name>Selbitz</div> Der Hauptmann?</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Knecht</div> Ja, Herr.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Selbitz</div> Wohl! Wohl!</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Knecht</div> Weh! Weh! Götzen seh’ ich nicht mehr.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Selbitz</div> So stirb, Selbitz!</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Knecht</div> Ein fürchterlich Gedräng wo er stund. Georgs blauer Busch verschwindt auch.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Selbitz</div> Komm herunter. Siehst du Lersen nicht?</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Knecht</div> Nichts. Es geht alles drunter und drüber.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Selbitz</div> Nichts mehr. Komm! Wie halten sich Sickingens Reiter?</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Knecht</div> Gut. – Da flieht Einer nach dem Wald. Noch Einer! Ein ganzer Trupp! Götz ist hin.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Selbitz</div> Komm herab.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Knecht</div> Ich kann nicht. – Wohl! Wohl! Ich sehe Götzen! Ich sehe Georgen!</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Selbitz</div> Zu Pferd?</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Knecht</div> Hoch zu Pferd! Sieg! Sieg! Sie fliehn.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Selbitz</div> Die Reichstruppen?</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Knecht</div> Die Fahne mitten drinn, Götz hintendrein. Sie zerstreuen sich. Götz erreicht den Fähndrich – Er hat die Fahn – Er hält. Eine Hand voll Menschen um ihn herum. Mein Kamerad erreicht ihn – Sie ziehn herauf.</div>

            <div class=env>Götz. Georg. Lerse. Ein Trupp.</div>

            <div class=speech><div class=name>Selbitz</div> Glück zu! Götz. Sieg! Sieg!</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz (steigt vom Pferd)</div> Theuer! Theuer! Du bist verwundt, Selbitz?</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Selbitz</div> Du lebst und siegst! Ich habe wenig gethan. Und meine Hunde von Reitern! Wie bist du davon gekommen?</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Dießmal galt’s! Und hier Georgen dank’ ich das Leben, und hier Lersen dank’ ich’s. Ich warf den Hauptmann vom Gaul. Sie stachen mein Pferd nieder und drangen auf mich ein. Georg hieb sich zu mir und sprang ab, ich wie der Blitz auf seinen Gaul, wie der Donner saß er auch wieder. Wie kamst du zum Pferd?</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Georg</div> Einem, der nach euch hieb, stieß ich meinen Dolch in die Gedärme, wie sich sein Harnisch in die Höhe zog. Er stürzt’, und ich half euch von einem Feind und mir zu einem Pferde.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Nun staken wir, bis sich Franz zu uns hereinschlug, und da mähten wir von innen heraus.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Lerse</div> Die Hunde die ich führte sollten von außen hinein mähen bis sich unsere Sensen begegnet hätten; aber sie flohen wie Reichsknechte.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Es flohe Freund und Feind. Nur du kleiner Hauf hieltest mir den Rücken frei; ich hatte mit den Kerls vor mir genug zu thun. Der Fall ihres Hauptmanns half mir sie schütteln und sie flohen. Ich habe ihre Fahne und wenig Gefangene.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Selbitz</div> Der Hauptmann ist euch entwischt?</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Sie hatten ihn inzwischen gerettet. Kommt, Kinder! kommt, Selbitz! – Macht eine Bahre von Ästen; – du kannst nicht auf’s Pferd. Komm in mein Schloß. Sie sind zerstreut. Aber unser sind wenig, und ich weiß nicht ob sie Truppen nachzuschicken haben. Ich will euch bewirthen, meine Freunde. Ein Glas Wein schmeckt auf so einen Strauß.</div>

            <div class=env>Hauptmann.</div>

            <div class=speech><div class=name>Hauptmann</div> Ich möcht’ euch alle mit eigner Hand umbringen! Was, fortlaufen! Er hatte keine Hand voll Leute mehr! Fortzulaufen, vor Einem Mann! Es wird’s niemand glauben, als wer über uns zu lachen Lust hat. – Reit herum, ihr, und ihr, und ihr. Wo ihr von unsern zerstreuten Knechten findt, bringt sie zurück oder stecht sie nieder. Wir müssen diese Scharten auswetzen, und wenn die Klingen drüber zu Grunde gehen sollten.</div>

            <div class=env>Jaxthausen.</div>
            <div class=env>Götz. Lerse. Georg.</div>

            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Wir dürfen keinen Augenblick säumen! Arme Jungen, ich darf euch keine Rast gönnen. Jagt geschwind herum und sucht noch Reiter aufzutreiben. Bestellt sie alle nach Weilern, da sind sie am sichersten. Wenn wir zögern, so ziehen sie mir vor’s Schloß. (Die Zwei ab.) Ich muß einen auf Kundschaft ausjagen. Es fängt an heiß zu werden, und wenn es nur noch brave Kerls wären! aber so ist’s die Menge. (Ab.)</div>

            <div class=env>Sickingen. Maria.</div>

            <div class=speech><div class=name>Maria</div> Ich bitte euch, lieber Sickingen, geht nicht von meinem Bruder! Seine Reiter, Selbitzens, eure, sind zerstreut; er ist allein, Selbitz ist verwundet auf sein Schloß gebracht, und ich fürchte alles.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Sickingen</div> Seid ruhig, ich gehe nicht weg.</div>

            <div class=env>Götz kommt.</div>

            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Kommt in die Kirch, der Pater wartet. Ihr sollt mir in einer Viertelstund ein Paar sein.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Sickingen</div> Laßt mich hier.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> In die Kirch sollt ihr jetzt.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Sickingen</div> Gern – und darnach?</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Götz</div> Darnach sollt ihr eurer Wege gehn.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Sickingen</div> Götz!</div>

            <div class=speech><div class=name>Ritter</div> Hundert und funfzig.</div>
            <div class=speech><div class=name>Hauptmann</div> Von Vierhunderten! Das ist arg. Jetzt gleich auf und grad gegen Jaxthausen zu, eh er sich wieder erholt und sich uns wieder in Weg stellt.</div>

                        Reese's Pieces are a peanut butter candy
                        manufactured by The Hershey Company for the
                        North American market; they are also available
                        in Ireland and the United Kingdom. They are
                        oblate spheroid in shape and covered in candy
                        shells that are colored yellow, orange, or
                        brown. They can be purchased in plastic
                        packets, cardboard boxes, or cup-shaped travel
                        containers. The candy was introduced in 1978
                        and introduced to Canada in 1980. The then
                        relatively new product became very popular
                        with the 1982 release of E.T. the
                        Extra-Terrestrial, in which the candy is
                        featured.

                        Reese's Pieces are a product extension of the
                        Reese's Peanut Butter Cups line; this new
                        product was designed to capitalize on the
                        success of the chocolate-covered peanut butter

                        imported, including from Dutch firms Steenland

                        up with the slogan, won $10, while Mounds went
                        on to use the slogan in advertising and on the
                        wrappers, still continuing today.

                        Mounds uses a packaging and logo design
                        similar to its sister product, with Almond
                        Joy's blue replaced by red, and the two
                        candies are often advertised together. The
                        candy's famous 1970s ad campaign used a
                        jingle, "Sometimes you feel like a nut,
                        sometimes you don't / Almond Joy's got nuts /
                        Mounds don't", written by Leon Carr.

                        Massachusetts in 1890. It was reincorporated
                        as the Squirrel Brand Company, which moved to
                        Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1903. In 1915 it
                        moved its factory again to 12 Boardman Street
                        in the Area 4 neighborhood of Cambridge, where
                        it stayed until 1999. That year, the company
                        was sold and moved to McKinney, Texas, where a
                        nut-processing operation continues.

                        However, in 2004 the Necco company brought the
                        Squirrel Nut candy brand back to
                        Massachusetts.

                        Cadbury is a British multinational
                        confectionery company owned by Mondelēz
                        International. It is the second largest
                        confectionery brand in the world after
                        Wrigley's. Cadbury is headquartered in
                        Uxbridge in Greater London and operates in
                        more than fifty countries worldwide.

                        <br/>
                        <br/>

                        Cadbury is best known for its confectionery
                        products including the Dairy Milk chocolate,
                        the Creme Egg, and the Roses selection box.

                        <br/>
                        <br/>

                        Cadbury was established in Birmingham, England
                        in 1824, by John Cadbury who sold tea, coffee
                        and drinking chocolate. Cadbury developed the
                        business with his brother Benjamin, followed
                        by his sons Richard and George. George
                        developed the Bournville estate, a model
                        village designed to give the company's workers
                        improved living conditions. Dairy Milk
                        chocolate, introduced in 1905, used a higher
                        proportion of milk within the recipe compared
                        with rival products. By 1914, the chocolate
                        was the company's best-selling product.

                        <br/>
                        <br/>

                        Cadbury merged with J. S. Fry & Sons in 1919,
                        and Schweppes in 1969. Cadbury was a constant
                        constituent of the FTSE 100 from the index's
                        1984 inception until the company was bought by
                        Kraft Foods in 2010.

                        The Hershey Process milk chocolate used in
                        these bars is cheaper to make than other types
                        of chocolate as it is less sensitive to the
                        freshness of the milk. The process was
                        developed by Milton Hershey and was the first
                        mass-produced chocolate in the United
                        States. As a result, the Hershey flavor is
                        widely recognized in the United States, but
                        less so internationally, in particular in
                        areas where European chocolates are more
                        widely available. The process is a trade
                        secret, but experts speculate that the milk is
                        partially lipolyzed, producing butyric acid,
                        which stabilizes the milk from further
                        fermentation. This compound gives the product
                        a particular sour, "tangy" taste, to which the
                        US public has become accustomed, to the point
                        that other manufacturers often add butyric
                        acid to their milk chocolates. The American
                        bar's taste profile was not as popular with
                        the Canadian public, leading Hershey to
                        introduce a reformulated Canadian bar in
                        1983. The company describes the revised
                        Canadian formulation as a "creamier, smoother,
                        lighter coloured and milder flavoured product
                        more suitable to Canadian taste". Butyric acid
                        is a component which provides the
                        characteristic smell of human vomit, and many
                        Europeans describe the taste of Hershey bars
                        as reminding them of vomit, even if they do
                        not know the underlying chemistry.

                        of York, England, and is now produced globally
                        by Nestlé (which acquired Rowntree in 1988)

                        Company, a division of The Hershey
                        Company. Each bar consists of fingers composed
                        of three layers of wafer, covered in an outer
                        layer of chocolate. Each finger can be snapped
                        from the bar separately. Bars typically have
                        two or four fingers, although the larger Kit
                        Kat Chunky bars are a single solid block
                        marked into three sections.

                        Many varieties of Kit Kat have existed, either
                        permanently or as limited editions, such as
                        those sold to commemorate festivals such as
                        St. Valentine's Day. In
                        Japan, Nestlé has introduced over 200
                        different flavours since 2000, including
                        ginger ale, soy sauce, creme brulee, green
                        tea, and banana. The flavours are designed
                        to appeal to younger buyers, and are often
                        bought as good-luck gifts as the brand name
                        echoes the Japanese phrase "Kitto Katsu",
                        roughly translating as "surely win."

                        Maltesers are a confectionery product
                        manufactured by Mars, Incorporated. Maltesers
                        consist of a roughly spherical malt honeycomb
                        centre, surrounded by milk
                        chocolate. Maltesers are sold in a variety of
                        packaging, including plastic bags (ranging in
                        size from small 'fun-size' upwards), larger
                        cardboard boxes and tubes, and plastic buckets
                        (ranging in size from medium to very
                        large). They also have medium sized "teasers"
                        in Celebrations boxes. Maltesers are also one
                        of the types of sweet included in Mars's
                        Revels assortment.

                        <br/>

                        The current Maltesers' slogan is "The lighter
                        way to enjoy chocolate" - earlier slogans have
                        included "The Dri Drink", "The chocolates with
                        the less fattening centre", "No ordinary
                        chocolate" and "Nothing pleases like
                        Maltesers". The Australian version also
                        contains the line: "Made in
                        Australia... ...exported to the world." In the
                        1930s, advertisements claimed that the
                        Maltesers honeycomb centre is seven times less
                        fattening than ordinary chocolate centres;
                        this led marketers to claim it was beneficial
                        for weight loss.

                        In 2011, the product gained Fairtrade
                        accreditation in the UK and Ireland by
                        sourcing all their cocoa and sugar under

                        other countries. The non-US Milky Way bar, on
                        the other hand, is not topped with caramel and
                        is therefore similar to the American 3
                        Musketeers bar.

                        <br/>
                        <br/>

                        The European version of the bar has no caramel
                        topping, and consists of a nougat center that
                        is considerably lighter than that of the Mars
                        bar. Because of this low density (0.88 g/cm3),
                        it floats when placed in milk. This rare
                        attribute was used for an advertising campaign
                        in Germany, France, Russia, Belgium, Ireland,
                        Poland, the Netherlands and the United
                        Kingdom.

                        <br/>
                        <br/>

                        Originally available within Europe only in
                        chocolate flavor, the center changed to
                        vanilla flavor at around 1993, although the
                        chocolate flavor still remains available in
                        Australia. The bar is also available in
                        banana, mango and strawberry flavors. In the
                        UK, Mars introduced the Flyte bar which is
                        identical to the old-style chocolate flavored
                        Milky Way but only comes in twin packs. Also
                        available in Europe are Milky Way Crispy
                        Rolls, chocolate covered wafer rolls with a
                        milk-cream filling.

                        Mackintosh's, (later Rowntree-Mackintosh),
                        simply a combination of Mackintosh's Toffee
                        and a chocolate coating - the acquisition of
                        Caley's of Norwich had also led to the Quality
                        Street line. Rolo was first sold in 1937.

                        family. The Snickers candy bar consists of
                        nougat, peanuts, and caramel with a chocolate

                        Abba-Zaba are taffy candy bars with peanut
                        butter centers, made by Annabelle Candy
                        Company in Hayward, California.

                        <br/>
                        <br/>

                        According to the Candy Wrapper Museum, the
                        first Abba Zaba bars were manufactured
                        beginning in 1922 by Colby and McDermott.
                        Before Annabelle Candy Co. started
                        manufacturing Abba-Zaba, the packaging
                        featured imagery which some now consider to be
                        racially biased. Annabelle Candy Co. will
                        only say that the wrapper has been the same
                        for as long as they have manufactured the
                        candy.

                        <br/>
                        <br/>

                        The bar was later manufactured by the Cardinet
                        Candy Co. along with U-No Bar. Annabelle Candy
                        Purchased the Cardinet Candy Co. in
                        1978. Annabelle now manufactures both candy
                        bars in addition to others.

<div class="header align_center">As you noticed</div>


<p class=normal>
  <span class=intenceName>intence</span> does not provide any controls
  for changing the scrolling position, and this was done
  intentionally.  From now the issues of scrolling indication and
  scrolling control are
  separated: <span class=intenceName>intence</span> designates what is
  scrollable, and is supposed to work along with a navigation widget,
  like the menu on the right side. It can be a pager, or an area with
  small previews, a progress bar, or something totally new and
  different. For instance, have a look
  at <a href="https://asvd.github.io/viewport/">some examples of the
  navigation components</a> created with a
  <a href="https://github.com/asvd/viewport">viewport.js
  library</a>. Just like as <span class=intenceName>intence</span>
  better than the scrollbar designates the scrollable area, such
  components can be designed for the needs of a particular application
  and solve the navigation issue in a more efficient manner.

        <p>
          <span class=intenceName>intence</span> is shipped as an
          open-source javascript library
          [<a href="https://github.com/asvd/intence/">Github</a>]
          &mdash; so you can easily install it on your site or a
          web-application. It works on recent versions of major
          browsers (on others it will simply leave the scrollbar
          untouched):
        </p>



        <div class=browsers>
          <div class=browser><img src="browsers/chrome.png"/><div>15+</div></div>
          <div class=browser><img src="browsers/opera.png"/> <div>15+</div></div>
          <div class=browser><img src="browsers/ie.png"/><div>9+</div></div>
          <div class=browser><img src="browsers/ff.png"/><div>8+</div></div>
          <div class=browser><img src="browsers/safari.png"/><div>7+</div></div>
        </div>

        

        <p>
          Download and unpack the library:
          <a href="https://github.com/asvd/intence/releases/download/v1.1.4/intence-1.1.4.tar.gz">intence-1.1.4.tar.gz</a>
          (10KB), or install it
          using <a href="http://bower.io/">Bower</a>:
        </p>

        <div class=code>
          <pre class="sh"><span class='dollar'>$</span> bower install intence</pre>
        </div>

        <p>
            Load <span class=inline_code>intence.js</span> into
            your project (that is an UMD module):
        </p>

        <div class=code>
          <pre name="code" class="html">&lt;script src="intence.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
        </div>
        
        <p>
            Create a scrollable element with the content in a usual
            way so that it is equipped with a scrollbar by a browser:
        </p>


        <div class=code>
          <pre name="code" class="html">&lt;div id=myElem&gt;
    Big text goes here...
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
        </div>
        
        <div class=code>
          <pre name="code" class="css">#myElem {
    width : 200px;
    height : 400px;
    overflow: auto;
}</pre>
        </div>


        <p>
            Add the <span class=inline_code>intence</span> class to
            the element, and specify an image to be used for the
            indicator as a value of
            the <span class=inline_code>scrollImg</span> attribute:
        </p>

        <div class=code>
          <pre name="code" class="html">&lt;div id=myElem class=intence scrollImg=texture.png&gt;
    Big text goes here...
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
        </div>
        

        <p>
          That's it! Now the scrollbar is replaced with
          the <span class=intenceName>intence</span> indicator
          composed out of
          the <span class=inline_code>texture.png</span>. You can also
          apply the <span class=inline_code>intence</span> class to
          the <span class=inline_code>&lt;body&gt;</span> element and
          get the whole page indicated.
        </p>

    </div>

    <div class=section dark img=menu/10_texture.png>

        <p>
          When selecting a texture for indication, have in mind that
          it will be <span class=strongly>strongly</span> squeezed
          vertically:
        </p>


        <div class="center w100per">
          <img src=squeeze.png width=350/>
        </div>


        
        <p class="subtitle align_center">
          The shapes on the texture can be highly detailed
          horizontally, but should have significant size in vertical
          dimension
        </p>

        
        <p>
          The texture image is rotated to have its top oriented
          towards a side of a scrollable area:
        </p>


      <div class="mid_floats w410">
        <div class="_200_200 float_left _frame_simple">
          <img src=rotate_orig.png width=200/>
        </div>
        <div class="_200_200 float_right _frame_simple">
          <img src=rotate_applied.png width=200/>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="mid_floats w410">
        <div class="w180 float_left subtitle align_center p10">
          original image
        </div>
        <div class="w180 float_right subtitle align_center p10">
          applied as indicator
        </div>
      </div>

    </div>

    <div class=section dark img=menu/11_roll.png>


      <div class=mid>
        <p>
          The texture rolls within an indicator at a different speed:
          the closer it is to the area side, the slower it moves. But
          additionally it depends on the height of the texture, which
          means you can affect the roll speed by selecting a higher or
          a lower image:
        </p>

        <p class="subtitle align_center">
          slowly scroll the areas by dragging and compare the roll speed
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="w500 float_left plus_l25">
        <div class="w220 float_left subtitle align_right">
          Higher texture makes indicator roll slower and more
          fluent. This is especially important for people who scroll
          with a mouse wheel and normally have a discrete
          jump-scrolling. Always prefer higher texture.
        </div>
        <div class="w220 float_right subtitle align_left">
          Indicator with lower texture moves faster and its speed at
          the far end from the side is getting closer to the content
          scrolling speed. This is useful if a texture looks like a
          continuation of the content, like in the Chinese scroll
          example above.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class=sep></div>

      <p>
        The indicator is growing up to 0.12 of the scrollable area
        size in the corresponding dimension. Additionally the
        indicator size cannot be more than approximately 0.6 of the
        texture height (due to some mathematical reasons). Therefore
        you can also use low texture to limit the maximal indicator
        size.
      </p>

    </div>

    <div class=section dark img=menu/12_blocks.png>

      <p>
        Indicator consists of a set of blocks, which are a little bit
        overlapped sometimes. In order to avoid dirty connections, do
        not use partially transparent areas around top and bottom
        sides of the texture. Moreover, prefer fully opaque images
        which will make the content fade out. This notifies a user
        that the content continues &mdash; actually even better than
        high contrast scrolling indicator:

      <p class=subtitle>
        Instead of using transparency, use the background of the
        scrollable content &mdash; the indicator still looks
        transparent, but the content is fading out additionally.
      </p>

      <p>
        Images containing high-contrast shapes or making high-contrast
        with the content area, should be avoided. Too much animation
        during scrolling may distract user so that he looses the focus.
      </p>

    </div>

    <div class=section dark img=menu/13_attrs.png>

      <p>
        The mentioned <span class=inline_code>scrollImg</span>
        attribute is used for all sides by default, but you may
        specify different texture for a particular side
        using <span class=inline_code>scrollImgNorth</span>, <span class=inline_code>scrollImgSouth</span>,
        <span class=inline_code>scrollImgEast</span> and <span class=inline_code>scrollImgWest</span> attributes:
      </p>

        <div class=code>
          <pre name="code" class="html">&lt;div class=intence
     scrollImg=texture.png
     scrollImgNorth=north.png&gt;
    Big text goes here...
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
        </div>

        <p class="subtitle align_center">
          &mdash; use north.png for the top side, and tetxure.png for
          every other side
        </p>


        <p>
          As shown in the examples above, there is a special maximal
          mode to be activated in case of infinite scrolling or
          dynamically appended content (when it is not known in
          advance how much of content is still to be added). Such
          behaviour of an indicator is triggered by
          the <span class=inline_code>scrollInfiniteNorth</span>, <span class=inline_code>scrollInfiniteSouth</span>, <span class=inline_code>scrollInfiniteWest</span>
          and <span class=inline_code>scrollInfiniteEast</span>
          attributes, for instance:
        </p>
        
        <div class=code>
          <pre name="code" class="html">&lt;div id=myElem
     class=intence
     scrollImg=texture.png
     scrollInfiniteSouth&gt;
    Big text goes here...
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
        </div>

        <p class="subtitle align_center">
          &mdash; the bottom side will always be in maximal mode,
          regardles of how much is it to scroll yet
        </p>

        <p>
          After the last piece of content is delivered and appended to
          the scrollable area, remove the attribute programmatically:
        </p>
        
        <div class=code>
<pre name="code" class="js">var elem = document.getElementById('myElem');
elem.removeAttribute('scrollInfiniteSouth');
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>
          This will smoothly decrease the indicator to the proper size
          reflecting the amount of remaining content (this does not
          happen instantly upon the attribute removal, but upon the
          next act of scrolling instead).
        </p>


    </div>

    <div class=section dark img=menu/14_reset.png>


        <p>
          If a browser is too
          old, <span class=intenceName>intence</span> is not enabled,
          and will not change anythig on the page. You can determine
          if this is the case by checking
          the <span class=inline_code>intence.enabled</span> property
          &mdash; it contains <span class=inline_code>true</span>
          if <span class=intenceName>intence</span> works,
          and <span class=inline_code>false</span> otherwise.
        </p>

        <p>
          Upon the indicator is created for an element, its internal
          structure is rebuilt in order to hide the scrollbars and
          create the indicator. The original element does not actually
          perform scrolling anymore, so if you need to operate the
          scrolling programmatically (to find out the current
          scrolling position, or to change it), you can find the
          actual scroller element at
          the <span class=inline_code>.scroller</span> property of the
          original element:
        </p>
        
        <div class=code>
<pre name="code" class="js">// this will not work
// document.getElementById('myElem').scrollTop;

// use this instead
document.getElementById('myElem').scroller.scrollTop;
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>
          The <span class=inline_code>scroller</span> property is
          available even in case
          if <span class=intenceName>intence</span> is disabled (in
          this case it simply points to the element itself), so there
          is no need to additionally check
          the <span class=inline_code>intence.enabled</span> flag.
        </p>


        <p>
          Finally if you add (or remove)
          the <span class=inline_code>intence</span> class to the
          element dynamically (or after the page load),
          notify <span class=intenceName>intence</span> so that it
          creates / removes indicators for the respective elements:
        </p>


        <div class=code>
          <pre name="code" class="js">intence.reset();</pre>
        </div>


    </div>

  <div class=line></div>

    <div class=section dark img=menu/15_final.png>

        <p>
          As already mentioned, <span class=intenceName>intence</span>
          splits the issues of scrolling indication, and scrolling
          control. Namely, <span class=intenceName>intence</span> is
          only an indicator, and does not provide elements to control
          the scrolling position &mdash; instead it is supposed to be
          solved by a developer for a particular application.
        </p>

        <p>
          Think on which kind of navigation a human needs. In some
          cases it might probably be enough to simply rely on a mouse
          wheel or a touchscreen. But it will likely be convenient for
          a human to have something additional &mdash; slider buttons
          for an image gallery, or a content preview with the detailed
          position designated, like in Sublime Text.
        </p>


        <p>
          Here are some ideas. Add an opportunity to scroll the
          content with a click-and-hold style
          using <a href="https://github.com/asvd/dragscroll"
          target=_blank>dragscroll</a> library (this is how areas on
          this page can be scrolled). Create an interactive navigation
          menu which reflects the scrolling state relatively to the
          page sections &mdash; this can be done with
          the <a href="https://github.com/asvd/viewport">viewport.js
          library</a> (the menu on this page uses that library, also
          have a look at
          some <a href="https://asvd.github.io/viewport/">addititonal
          examples</a>). Use <a href="https://github.com/asvd/naturalScroll">natural
          scroll</a> if your navigation component scrolls the viewport
          (by clicking on the menu item, for instance).
        </p>

        <p>
          If you are going to create a library which provides some
          controls for scrolling to be used along
          with <span class=intenceName>intence</span>, do not cover
          the internal content of a scrollable area, or
          the <span class=intenceName>intence</span> indicator. The
          indicator is currently transparent for mouse events, and
          should remain like this (otherwise people will consider the
          controls as being part
          of <span class=intenceName>intence</span> and will be
          confused by it only working in some applications). Put the
          controls outside of the area, and not inside it. Do not
          recreate the scrollbar.
        </p>
