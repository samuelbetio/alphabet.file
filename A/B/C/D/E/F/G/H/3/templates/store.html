  <p>As a young child, Kathy Gruver discovered a gift for helping, first by massaging her father's neck during car trips, then by assisting a massage therapist who took the kinks out of Gruver and her fellow college acting students. An only child, unpopular in school, she watched her mother suffer with cancer for nine years, and observed her father as devoted caregiver. Finding outlets in theatre and dance, Gruver came west to forge a career as an actress. Along the way, she discovered healing modalities, became a massage therapist, and shares her gift of finding what her clients' real problems were beyond their presenting symptoms. She continued to pursue higher learning and advanced degrees. Her motto: Go for it. Her desire in life: helping others. To become the best at what she does, she delved deeply into numerous modalities, which she shares with readers, liberally sprinkled with detailed information as well as anecdotes both heartwarming and heartbreaking, about herself and her many memorable clients over the last twenty years. Gruver demystifies nutrition, meditation, reiki, massage (even how to set up your own practice, as well as the numerous opportunities for employment in the field and how to determine the one for you), homeopathy, herbs, affirmations, cancer, hypnosis, and more. Gruver's literal journey led her to such places as Stonehenge and flying trapeze; her journey toward self-acceptance was furthered as an artist's model and being stranded in a foreign country. While her journey may not be ours, it's there for us to savor and learn and grow.</p>

<p>If only everyone would honestly ask "Who's the Matter with Me" and recognize that it is usually you, yourself, we would all be better.  Meanwhile, as Kathy reveals, body workers may help a great deal more than mind workers!</p>

<ul>
  <li class="faq"><p>The instruction was easy to understand and detailed without being monotonous; diction was clear, distinct and expressive; music was original and soothing; and the organization was good, I particularly liked the 'with' and 'without' instruction sections. I can't wait to get home and try it. </p> <p>~ Steven B, ND</p></li>
