    </div>

      <div>
        Fuckcapslock is a JavaScript library which negotiates the
        effect of the CapsLock button &mdash; the case of the typed
        characters is not affected any longer, and the whole page
        behaves as if CapsLock was never active.
      </div>
      <textarea>You can try it yourself by switching the CapsLock on and off on your keyboard (if you have it LOL), and entering some text into this textarea.</textarea>

    <div class=title>Why?</div>

      <p>
        The CapsLock button has very attractive position &mdash; it is
        located in the home row (the one in the middle, where your
        hands lie relaxed) and is therefore easily accessible without
        bending the fingers. In fact, it's more accessible than any
        other non-letter key.
      </p>


      <p>
        For historical reasons, the most accessible button has the
        most stupid function assigned to it &mdash; TO MAKE ALL THE
        TYPED CHARACTERS APPEAR IN CAPS. This rudimental side-effect
        made the button useless for other purposes.
      </p>


      <p>
        Until now. With fuckcapslock.js the state of the CapsLock key
        is disregarded. There is yet an opprotunity to handle its
        events and reuse the button as a convenient hotkey or a
        modifier. It exposes the keyboard events in the normal way and
        can be identified by the key code 20 or code 'CapsLock'. Just
        like as this indicator reflects you pushing the CapsLock:
      </p>

</div>

      <div id=caps_indicator class=caps_released>CapsLock</div>


      <p>
        Also you can inculcate your users the good manners so that
        they type in a normal case.
      </p>

    <div class=title>No way! ENTERING THE TEXT IN ALL CAPS IS OFTEN NEEDED!!</div>

    <p>
      Acutally we can live without it.
    </p>


    <p>
      Text in all capitals is harder to read (because all the letters
      have the same shape). If you still wish to use the CapsLock when
      typing an expressive message and you want to SHOUT OUT LOUD,
      just remind yourself that in real life shouting requires some
      extra effort. So if you are trying to express yourself in the
      similar way while typing a message &mdash; be so kind to make a
      little effort as well &mdash; HOLD THE FUCKING SHIFT.
    </p>


    <p>
      Special cases (data type implies input in capitals) can be
      predicted during development and should be respectively
      processed upon input regardless of the CapsLock state. For
      example:
    </p>

    Enter your name as it appears on your credit card (just kidding).

    <p>
      Besides, typing in ALL CAPS is not the most useful function, and
      definitely it does not deserve the most accessible button.
    </p>


    <div class=title>How to use</div>

    <p>
      fuckcapslock.js is an open-source library [github]
    </p>

    <p>
      Include fuckcapslock.js the very first in your project:
    </p>

    <p>
      Track the CapsLock keypress as following, checking against the keycode == 20 or code == 'CapsLock':
    </p>


    <div class=title>What exactly does fuckcapslock.js</div>

    <p>
      It tracks the state of the CapsLock upon keyboard events, and if
      the CapsLock is on, it does the following:
    <p>

    <ul>

      <li>
        Changing the content of the inputs, textareas and
        content-editable divs is prevented, the library then inserts
        the characters which would appear if the CapsLock was
        inactive;
      </li>

      <li>
        Keyboard events (keyup, keydown and keypress) are taken over,
        suppressed, and re-emitted with updated properties as those
        would be if the CapsLock was inactive.
      </li>

    </ul>

    <div class=title>Compatibility</div>

    <p>
      Fuck CapsLock! Make use of the button! Make the world a better place! <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Make America great again!</span>
    </p>
