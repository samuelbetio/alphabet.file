        <hr>

        <h4>7. API Terms</h4>

        <p>You may access your Harvest account data using the Harvest API (Application Programming Interface). Any use of the API, including use of the API through a third-party product that accesses Harvest, is bound by these Terms.</p>

        <p>You expressly understand and agree that we shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages, including but not limited to damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data, or other intangible losses (even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages) resulting from your use of the API or third-party products that access your data via the API.</p>

        <p>Abuse or excessively frequent requests to Harvest via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your access to the API. We may, at our sole discretion, determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We reserve the right at any time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, your access to the API (or any part thereof) with or without notice.</p>

        <hr>

        <h4>8. Indemnification</h4>

        <p>You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from any and all demands, loss, liability, claims or expenses (including attorneys’ fees) made against us by any third party due to or arising out of or in connection with your use of Harvest.</p>

        <hr>

        <h4>9. Representations and Warranties</h4>

        <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, we provide Harvest on an “as is” and “as available” basis, which means we don’t provide warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including, but not limited to, warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose and to any warranties that (i) Harvest will meet your specific requirements, (ii) Harvest will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free, (iii) the results that may be obtained from the use of Harvest will be accurate or reliable, (iv) the quality of any products, services, information, or other material purchased or obtained by you through Harvest will meet your expectations, and (v) any errors in Harvest will be corrected.</p>

        <hr>

        <h4>10. Limitation of Liability</h4>

        <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, you assume full responsibility for and we disclaim liability to you for any indirect, consequential, exemplary, incidental, or punitive damages, including lost profits, even if we had been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>

        <p>We disclaim any and all liability for the acts, omissions, and conduct of any third parties related to your use of Harvest and any linked sites and services. Your sole remedy against us for dissatisfaction with Harvest is to stop using Harvest. This limitation of relief is a part of the bargain between you and us. The preceding disclaimer applies to any damages, liability, or injuries whether for breach of contract, tort, negligence or any other cause of action.</p>

        <p>If, notwithstanding the other provisions of the Terms, we are found to be liable to you for any damage or loss which arises out of or is in any way connected with your use of the Website or any  of our Services, our liability shall not exceed what you paid us for the Services in the previous month.  Some jurisdictions do not allow limitations of liability, so the foregoing limitation may not apply to you.</p>

        <hr>

        <h4>11. Governing Law; Dispute Resolution</h4>

        <p>You agree that all matters relating to your access to or use of Harvest, including all disputes, will be governed by the laws of the United States and by the laws of the State of New York without regard to its conflicts of laws provisions. You agree to the personal jurisdiction by and venue in the state and federal courts in New York County, New York, and waive any objection to such jurisdiction or venue. Any claim under these Terms of Use must be brought within one (1) year after the cause of action arises, or such claim or cause of action is barred.</p>

        <p>No recovery may be sought or received for damages other than out-of-pocket expenses, except that the prevailing party will be entitled to costs and attorneys’ fees. In the event of any controversy or dispute between us and you arising out of or in connection with your use of the Websites or Services, the parties shall attempt, promptly and in good faith, to resolve any such dispute. If we are unable to resolve any such dispute within a reasonable time (not to exceed thirty (30) days), then either party may submit such controversy or dispute to mediation. If the dispute cannot be resolved through mediation, then the parties shall be free to pursue any right or remedy available to them under applicable law.</p>

        <hr>

        <h4>12. Force Majeure</h4>

        <p>You agree that we are not liable for any delays or failure in performance of any part of the Services, from any cause beyond our control.</p>

        <hr>

        <h4>13. Severability</h4>

        <p>If one or more sections of the Terms are held unenforceable, then those sections will be removed or edited as little as necessary, and the rest of the Terms will still be valid and enforceable.</p>

        <hr>

        <h4>14. Assignments</h4>

        <p>You may not assign any of your rights under this agreement to anyone else. We may assign our rights to any other individual or entity at our discretion.</p>

        <hr>

        <h4>15. No Waiver</h4>

        <p>Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>

        <hr>

        <h4>16. Entire Agreement</h4>

        <p>These Terms and all documents incorporated into these Terms by reference constitute the entire agreement between you and us and govern your use of Harvest, superseding any prior agreements between you and us (including, but not limited to, any prior versions of the Terms of Service).</p>

        <hr>

        <h4>17. Amendments and Changes to Harvest</h4>

        <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions of the Terms, at any time. Amendments or changes to these Terms won’t be effective until we post revised Terms on the Website. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any new features that augment or enhance Harvest shall be subject to the Terms.</p>

        <p>It is your responsibility to check the Terms periodically for changes. Your continued use of Harvest following the posting of changes will mean that you accept and agree to the changes.</p>

        <p>We reserve the right to do any of the following, at any time, without notice to you: (1) to modify, suspend or terminate operation of or access to Harvest, or any portion of Harvest for any reason; (2) to modify or change Harvest, or any portion of Harvest, and any applicable policies or terms; and (3) to interrupt the operation of Harvest, or any portion of Harvest, as necessary to perform routine or non-routine maintenance, error correction, or other changes.</p>

        <hr>
